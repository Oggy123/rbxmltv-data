2016. Kyle Eastwood, Andrew McCormack, Quentin Collins &amp; Chris Higginbottom. Jazz a Ramatuelle, France</k><d>Bassist Kyle Eastwood (1968) is an explorer, equally at ease with jazz melodies as with pop songs. In the late 1970s, his father Clint took him to see his first jazz concert - a Count Basie performance. Eastwood Jr. was in awe of the drummer and wanted to play an instrument himself. It so happened he wasn't so much interested in jazz, preferring rhythm and blues, Motown and Stax records, funk groups, and North African and Indian music. Eastwood became a brilliant bassist and the composer of highly original soundtracks. His 2015 album &quot;Time Pieces&quot; is a collaboration with brilliant British musicians, such as trumpeter Quentin Collins and saxophonist Brandon Allen. In this broadcast, Eastwood and his fellow musicians revisit the hard bop legacy of Blue Note Records. Eastwood and his band perform original music, as well as songs made famous by Horace Silver and Herbie Hancock. Their contemporary take on Charles Mingus' &quot;Boogie Stop Shuffle&quot; is not to be missed!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190818/1310298212-Jazz-a-ramatuelle-kyle-eastwood-quintet</w></i><x></x></a>
