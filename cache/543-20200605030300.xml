Peter Gabriel has always been a charismatic live performer with the ability to draw his audience into the onstage world he has created and rarely has this been better captured than on &quot;Secret World Live&quot;. Peter Gabriel's Grammy Award winning film &quot;Secret World Live&quot; has now been newly restored and remastered from the original film to be seen and heard in the best possible quality.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200605/1410054407-Secret-world-live</w></i><x></x></a>
