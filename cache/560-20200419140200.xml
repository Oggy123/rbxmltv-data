The original story by John Dryden was situated at the courts of Lima and Mexico before the Spanish invasion. There, an impossible love story between the Queen of the Aztecs and the general of the Yncas developed to provoke an imaginary conflict between Yncas and Aztecs. Sellars personal vision is more political; it intertwines music, dance, literature, theatre, and visual arts and describes the first contact between the Europeans and the Mayas of the New World, a personal and choral narration of the Conquista through the lives of two women who created a new culture. MusicAeterna, under the baton of Teodor Currentzis, performed this opera in 2013 at the Teatro Real in Spain. The solo parts are sung by Vince Yi, Julia Bullock, Markus Brutscher, Nadine Koutcher, Noah Stewart, Christophe Dumaux and Luthando Qave.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200419/1390176944-Purcell-the-indian-queen</w></i><x></x></a>
