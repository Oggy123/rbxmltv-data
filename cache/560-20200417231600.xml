Leonidas Kavakos rose to fame in 1985, when he became the youngest musician to ever win the first price of the prestigious Sibelius Competition. With Yuja Wang, an accomplished artist at young age herself, he forms a masterful duo of chamber music interpretation. The programme features Brahm's Sonata for Piano and Violin, No. 1 in G major, Op. 78, also known as the &quot;Regensonate,&quot; Sonata for Piano and Violin, No. 2 in A major, Op. 100, the &quot;Thuner Sonata,&quot; a portrait of the Swiss lake of Thun's peaceful scenery. It comes to a fiery and passionate finale with Brahm's Sonata for Piano and Violin, No. 3 in D minor, Op 108.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200417/1390155899-Brahms-violin-sonata-no-2-op-100</w></i><x></x></a>
