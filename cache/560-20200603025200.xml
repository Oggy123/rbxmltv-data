Soloists are Magdalena Kožená (mezzo-soprano) and Christian Gerhaher (baritone). This concert was recorded at the orchestras home base, Severance Hall, in February 2010. Among Mahler's orchestral songs, those of Des Knaben Wunderhorn occupy a special position: written in the 1890s, they are of ground-breaking importance in his oeuvre, since they helped establish a genre that had few precedents before him. Moreover, they also served as sources of inspiration, both musical and poetic, for the symphonies he wrote during this time. Mahler famously said a symphony should take in the entire world. He'd be pleased, then, by this performance of the &quot;Adagio&quot; from the unfinished Symphony No. 10, which somehow packed the world into a single movement.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200603/1410021722-Mahler-10th-symphony-adagio-youth-s-magic-horn</w></i><x></x></a>
