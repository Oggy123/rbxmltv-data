Our base is the only floating hotel in the archipelago, but firmly anchored in one the channels in this labyrinth of small islands of los Jardines de la Reina, where the sea seems to be just a calm lake. We are accompanied by an expert biologist and together we discover this untouched mangrove eco-system, with herons, pelicans, cormorants and frigates flying overhead and inhabited by many forms of marine life. In the waters of this realm we see the biggest grouper in the world and swim with an enormous group of silk sharks, which are very famous in Los Jardines de la Reina.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200518/1400313705-Around-the-world-in-80-islands-in-the-kingdom-of-sharks-part-1-cuba</w></i><x></x></a>
