In this new adventure in the savannah of Garonga we learn more about genetic origin and the ancestors of birds. In a group will try to find out the more than 100 species of birds that inhabit the area, as well as identify 950 types of sounds made around the day. A new competition teams will test hearing and knowledge of students recognizing the greatest possible number of scribblers and despite being concentrated in it, will be surprised with pleasant surprises of mammals that appear in its path. In this new day we observe how group members learn how important it is for a safari guide, knowing and passionate about the fantastic world of feathered creatures.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20201101/1460171346-Garonga-safari-7</w></i><x></x></a>
