Opening things up is the British trombonist Charlie Galbraith's All Star Jazz Band, performing classic Dixieland jazz. Next up is German singer Knut Kiesewetter, who, with backing from the Prague Dixieland Band, sings the blues. Perhaps the highlight of this event is the coupling of American alto saxophonist Bud Shank with Dutch pianist Pim Jacobs' trio, who play standards and bossa nova. Bringing things to a close are French clarinetist Marc Laferriere and his New Orleans Stompers with more classic Dixieland.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200522/1400267430-Jazz-in-comblain-la-tour-1963</w></i><x></x></a>
