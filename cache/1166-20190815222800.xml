1978. Ornette Coleman. Schloss Ansbach, Ansbach, Germany</k><d>'Harmolodics', the musical philosophy of jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman, is associated primarily with avant-garde jazz and the free jazz movement, although its implications extend beyond these limits. Coleman defined 'harmolodics' as &quot;the use of the physical and the mental of one's own logic made into an expression of sound to bring about the musical sensation of unison executed by a single person or with a group&quot;. Applied to the particulars of music, this means that harmony, melody, speed, rhythm, time and phrases all have equal position in the results that come from the placing and spacing of ideas - as evidenced in this broadcast of a performance by the Ornette Coleman Sextet.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258184-Schloss-ansbach-ornette-coleman-sextet</w></i><x></x></a>
