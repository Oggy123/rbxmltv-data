Weerselo's Stift Church and Oldenzaal's 'Hofkerk' serve as venues for wonderful concerts of various young musicians from all over the world. The theme of the 2014 Stift Festival was &quot;Divine and Demonic Passion&quot;. Young musicians performed divine and demonic chamber music by composers such as Astor Piazzolla. Piazolla, who combined classical music and tango, created the 'Nuevo Tango' in the 1960s. In this period, he composed a number of tangos inspired on angels. These tangos had a spiritual touch. In the years before his death, Piazzolla used to perform this series of tangos as a single suite, the 'Suite del Ángel'. This four-tango suite has been performed in several instrumentations. Brava broadcasts the version for bandoneon accompanied by the guitar, violin, double bass, and piano.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20201106/1460050326-Stift-festival-suite-del-angel</w></i><x></x></a>
