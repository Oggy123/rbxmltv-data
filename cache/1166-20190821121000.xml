2017. Andy Sheppard, Michael Arbenz, Florian Arbenz &amp; Thomas Lähns. Volkshaus, Offbeat Jazzfestival, Basel, Switzerland</k><d>A sound support with provocative combinations, a modern music laboratory, a vehicle of inspiration whose importance has been proven by many high-profile collaborations. Music lovers who appreciate jazz for its ability to provoke and continuously question the status quo certainly do not expect that such a standard set in its configuration finds itself completely detached from tradition. But sometimes, the more the DNA of a set is anchored in tradition, the higher the margin to give way to novelty. Innovation is at the heart of the approach of VEIN, a bold Swiss ensemble composed of brothers Michael and Florian Arbenz, and bassist Thomas Lähns, for whom the term &quot;piano trio&quot; has long been too restrictive.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190821/1310335962-Vein-plays-ravel</w></i><x></x></a>
