2018. Franklin Kiermyer. Dizzy Club, Jazz at Lincoln Center, New York City, New York, United States</k><d>Scatter The Atoms That Remain is a jazz quartet consisting of drummer Franklin Kiermyer, saxophonist Jovan Alexandre, pianist Davis Whitfield, and bassist Otto Gardner. The group's music sounds like spiritual jazz. Yet, as Scatter The Atoms That Remain explains, their music is so much more. On the one hand, it is all about love, while on the other hand, it is about the transformative power of music. The quartet's performance should open the listener's hearts to that what lies beyond mere intellect: spirit and magic.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190818/1310298213-Scatter-the-atoms-that-remain-part-1</w></i><x></x></a>
