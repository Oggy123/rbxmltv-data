This episode of the Visions of Music series is about trumpet player Nicholas Payton, a dynamic performer who plays acoustic jazz and post-bop and enjoys going beyond the boundaries of traditional jazz. Considered by many to be one of the greatest artists of our time, Payton believes that the term &quot;jazz&quot; is old-fashioned and prefers to call it &quot;Black American Music&quot; (BAM). BAM combines spirituals, gospel, blues, jazz, and soul.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200519/1400182386-Visions-of-music-going-back-to-new-orleans</w></i><x></x></a>
