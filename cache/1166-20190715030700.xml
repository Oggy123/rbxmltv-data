2014. Frederik Meulyzer. MotorMusic, Mechelen, Belgium</k><d>The MotorMusic Studios in Mechelen, Belgium, attract many great musicians to the city. A wide variety of visiting international jazz musicians share their art of making jazz music with the DJAZZ series 'Belgium Sessions'. In these sessions, some of Europe's finest musicians perform their own, original music. This episode features energetic, unpolished jazz with a touch of humour: the young Antwerp band 'Hamster Axis of the one-click Panther'. The quintet showcases its unique sound: smooth yet sometimes deafening jazz with rock influences from their vocalist. The music of 'Hamster Axis of the one-click Panther' is wild, unpredictable, swinging, and infectious: in all, the band is everything a good band should be.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190715/1300237138-Motormusic-hamster-axis-of-the-one</w></i><x></x></a>
