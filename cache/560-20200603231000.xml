The quartet consists of Brian Bolger, Pat Brunnock, Tomas O'Durcain, and Chien Buggle. Not deterred by the scarcity of repertoire, the DGQ set about creating their own collection of work by focusing on transcriptions and new commissions. Their performances now boast a dynamic mix of celebrated masterpieces by the likes of Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Arvo Pärt and Bryce Dessner alongside new commissions by composers such as Nico Muhly, Michael Gordon, and Marc Mellits. During this showcase at Classical:NEXT 2019 in Rotterdam they perform the following program: Aheym by Bryce Dessner, Rachel Grimes' Book of Leaves (&quot;Every Morning,&quot; &quot;My Dear Companion,&quot; &quot;Every Morning,&quot; &quot;Birds&quot;), an arrangement of Philip Glass' Saxophone Quartet movement I and &quot;Changing of the Guard&quot; by Nikita Koshkin.</d></p><i><t>Zábava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200603/1410021741-Classical-next-2019-dublin-guitar-quartet</w></i><x></x></a>
