Hosted annually in Bremen, Germany, it brings together musicians, bookers, agents, organizers, jazz experts, and music enthusiasts. In 2019, jazzahead! pays special attention to Norway by selecting 40 jazz acts from all over the world and inviting them to perform over the course of three days. One of them is drummer and percussionist Peter Gall. He grew up in provincial Bavaria as the younger brother of pianist Chris Gall. Early on, Peter learned to go his own way and expand his musical horizons to places far beyond the conventional fascination for grooves. He studied in Berlin and New York, and soon attracted attention with sophisticated and very personal compositions that examine and attempt to overcome the paradox that lies at the core of jazz: the tension between complex structural organization and spontaneous improvisation.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200522/1400267423-Peter-gall-quintett-jazzahead</w></i><x></x></a>
