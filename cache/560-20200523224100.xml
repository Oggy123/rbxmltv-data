A. Mozart's &quot;Linzer&quot; Symphony No. 36 (K. 425). The broadcast is directed by JÃ¡nos Darvas. Mozart composed the work in 1783, during his short stay in the Austrian town of Linz, on the way home from Vienna to Salzburg. The symphony was written in an impressive span of only four days to accommodate a local concert. The premier took place on November 4 and premiered in Vienna the year after. The introduction of trumpets and drums in the second movement is an unusual feature of the piece. The closing Presto is provided with some contrapuntal passages to contrast the homophonic texture.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200523/1400271543-Mozart-symphony-no-36-k-425</w></i><x></x></a>
