<a><n>Genesis: Three Sides Live</n><s o="2020-05-19 09:00:00" d="2020-05-19 10:24:00" n="iConcerts" id_tv="543"></s><p><d>&quot;Three Sides Live&quot; was filmed in November 1981 on the &quot;Abacab&quot; tour in North America. Originally filmed in 16mm, the footage has now been fully restored. The show focuses on tracks from the &quot;Duke&quot; and &quot;Abacab&quot; albums and the tracks are intercut with behind the scenes footage and interviews with the band members. As ever with Genesis, the show is visually stunning and it captures the band in their transition from their progressive days in the seventies through to the hugely successful pop/rock act they became from the mid-eighties onwards. Genesis have always been great live performers and &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; is a great addition to any fans collection.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200519/1400287713-Genesis-three-sides-live</w></i><x></x></a>
