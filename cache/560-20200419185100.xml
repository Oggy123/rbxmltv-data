Geert Bierling stars as soloist on the organ of De Doelen. It was recorded on October 20th, 2018 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Saint-Saëns Symphony No. 3 was completed in 1886. It is known as the Organ Symphony since the instrument is used in the second and fourth movement of the work. The composer stated about this symphony: &quot;I gave everything to it I was able to give. What I have here accomplished, I will never achieve again.&quot; Saint-Saëns was at the height of his symphonic career, realizing this was his last attempt at the symphonic form.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200419/1390176946-Saint-sa-ns-symphony-no-3</w></i><x></x></a>
