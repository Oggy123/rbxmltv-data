At the heart of the story are the Ponies of Lampang. Located in Thailand's exotic northern Chiang Mai district, Lampang is home to several hundred working ponies. Recent DNA research has found that the ponies originated in Mongolia, as did most Thai people over a thousand years ago. Explore3D Travel looks into this fascinating story of how people and animals over time moved from one region of the world to another that could not be more different from each other: the vast, frigid, empty, open spaces of the Mongolian steppes and the remote mountains encircling them to the humid flatlands and jungles of Thailand.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200418/1390342083-Explore-travel-trails-of-a-legend-part-1</w></i><x></x></a>
