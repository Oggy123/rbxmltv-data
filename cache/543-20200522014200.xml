After the debut release, Mount started expanding the band's personnel: first by adding two members, and later increasing it by one more. Metronomy's critical acclaim comes from frenetically hybrid indie pop style knitted together with trademark electronic sounds inspired by Mount's favorite acts, namely Autechre and Funkstorung. Here Metronomy performs at Beck's Festival Bar, in Sydney, Australia, on January 15, 2009.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200522/1400435612-Live-at-beck-s-festival-bar</w></i><x></x></a>
