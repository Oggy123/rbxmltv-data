These inexpensive taxis are very much part of the city landscape and its history. Children goes to school on a Bajaj, women go shopping on a Bajaj and every Indonesian knows a Bajaj driver, by face and name. Cabbie Hasan is one such driver and he swears to go on strike if the government bans his Bajaj for good! vs Kolkata/Calcutta: Ambassador Cabs, a. k. a. &quot;the Kings of Indian Roads&quot;, can survive monsoon when streets are water logged or run over moon crater sized pot holes with ease. A Punjabi Sikh driving an Ambassador Cab is an iconic postcard picture to identify Kolkata city. Driving an Ambassador Cab runs in Devender’s family, but discover why the perils of the city’s infrastructure development is making the life of a cabbie harder by the day.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200608/1410106696-Taxi-to-asia-heritage-cabs-jakarta-vs-kolkata</w></i><x></x></a>
