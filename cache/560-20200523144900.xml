Menahem Pressler (1923-) is the soloist in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488). The career of the German-born Israeli-American pianist quickly launched after winning top prize at the Debussy International Piano Competition in San Francisco. During his extensive career, Pressler earned six Grammy nominations and a lifetime achievement award from Gramophone Magazin. Mozart finished his 23rd Piano Concerto in March 1786, only two months prior to the premiere of his Le nozze di Figaro. Stravinsky's Petrushka tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets. The ballet premiered in 1911, by Sergei Diaghilev's famous Ballets Russes, with Vaslav Nijinksy in the leading role. This concert is recorded at the Grand Auditorium of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation of Lisbon, in 2018.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200523/1400271535-Pianomania-menahem-pressler</w></i><x></x></a>
