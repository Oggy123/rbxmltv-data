The dish is prized for the thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Years of training are needed to perfect the various steps needed including the gutting of the duck right up to the carving of the duck into 120 slices under 10 mins. Teoh Minjun is a trainee chef with Jing, a chic modern-Chinese restaurant in Singapore. She has given herself 3 days to learn the skills where many have taken decades. Can MJ reconcile her modern sensibilities with the traditional methods her master is passing her?</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200422/1390342220-Kung-fu-kitchen-peking-duck-beijing-chnia</w></i><x></x></a>
