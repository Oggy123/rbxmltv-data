Huu Bac, Guillaume Martineau, Etienne Mason &amp; Zo√© Dumais. 2015</k><d>Huu Bac left Vietnam for Quebec at the age of two. This musician was first interested in jazz guitar, then in dan bau, an old monochord musical instrument, central to the folk music of Vietnam. Huu Bac's curiosity about ancient instruments led him to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, where he studied erhu, a traditional Chinese string instrument. Bac's work combines classical repertoire and Western influences.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190819/1310312878-Huu-bac-quintet-live-in-canada-15</w></i><x></x></a>
