Evil or Divine was shot in New York City at Roseland Ballroom at the end of 2002 in front of a sold out audience. The programme features all of the classic Dio tracks like, &quot;Holy Diver&quot;, &quot;Rainbow in The dark&quot;, and &quot;Last In Line&quot; as well as tracks from &quot;Killing The Dragon&quot;.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20201030/1450789978-Dio-evil-or-divine</w></i><x></x></a>
