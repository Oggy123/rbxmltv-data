On Valentine's Day 2011, 34 years later, they returned to their home town of Athens, Georgia to celebrate with this brilliant live show. Wig-wearing, boa-draped, glitter-covered fans came to join in and saw the band deliver a sizzling 90 minute set that turned Athens' Classic Center into a cosmic dancehall. A B-52s live show is always the best party in town, yet here in front of their home crowd they even managed to turn it up a notch further. Packed with all their fan's favourites, this is high spirited good time rock 'n' roll packed with great tunes, wild romance, blood pumping grooves and a lot of fun!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200602/1410029035-With-the-wild-crowd-live-in-athens-ga</w></i><x></x></a>
