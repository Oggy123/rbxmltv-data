The behind-the-scenes tour of the Teatro Regio di Parma, an established institution in the purest tradition of Italian opera, is an excellent demonstration of the current relevance of this art form, and offers a privileged opportunity to learn more about the staging of an opera. The actors involved are numerous, show sharp and often unique professional skills, and are motivated by a talent that is not always fully understood by the public. The staging of the opera Forza del destino offers a good starting point for understanding the workings of an operatic production. Presented for the first time in St. Petersburg in 1862, Giuseppe Verdi's opera is staged in Parma under the baton of maestro Stefano Poda.</d></p><i><t>ZÃ¡bava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200416/1390145915-In-opera-opera-parma</w></i><x></x></a>
