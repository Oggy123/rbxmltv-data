While Barris gains notoriety as a dynamic television producer--creating such innovative and popular shows as &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; and the self-hosted &quot;The Gong Show&quot;--he regularly executes assassinations for the United States government. As ratings rise, Barris incorporates his shows into his secret life: winning couples on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; find themselves shipped off to &quot;fabulous Helsinki&quot; and &quot;romantic West Berlin&quot; for their dream dates--it isn't Paris, but it provides chaperone Barris a cover for his covert missions. As Barris basks in the glamour of his two worlds--entertainment and espionage--his life begins to spiral out of control. He is torn between the woman who loves him and the mysterious woman of his fantasies. He receives mass criticism from the public who accuses him of contaminating the airwaves and he finds himself marked for death by an operative. Barris must regain control of his life. Both of them.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200519/1400494572-Confessions-of-a-dangerous-mind</w></i><x></x></a>
