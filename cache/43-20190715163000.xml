The documentary tells of the coming together of ten young international opera singers. They are between twenty and thirty years old and are unknown to each other. Scrupulously chosen by a team of professional musicians they are invited to the capital in order to take up a challenge: that of breathing life, in five days, into an original opera production conceived for them. 5 days during which these artists are going to get to know each other, come face to face to share their love of their art, and work relentlessly with a singing coach, a conductor and a stage director with the shared and ultimate aim of creating a unique and unprecedented performance.
