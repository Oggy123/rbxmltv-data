Estival offers a thrilling and particularly surprising line-up that explores the rich world of contemporary music whilst promoting the understanding of different cultures, tolerance, and co-existence. McCoy Tyner's first main exposure came with Benny Golson, being the first pianist in Golson's and Art Farmer's Jazztet. He's also known for his work with the John Coltrane Quartet. Tyner's style is easily comparable to Coltrane's maximalist style of saxophone. Though a member of Coltrane's group, he was never overshadowed by the saxophonist, but complemented and even inspired Coltrane's open-minded approach. McCoy Tyner is considered one of the most influential jazz pianists of the 20th century, an honour he earned both with Coltrane and in his years of performing following Coltrane's death.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200521/1400219688-Mccoy-tyner-trio-live-at-estival-lugano</w></i><x></x></a>
