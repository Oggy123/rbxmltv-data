He graduated with Honorable Mention and continued his piano studies at the Accademia Pianistica of Imola. Throughout his career, he has had the privilege of performing as a soloist under the baton of outstanding conductors, among the likes of Gustav Kuhn and Yuri Temirkanov. His acclaimed performances include recitals and concertos for piano and orchestra in many prestigious concert halls. One of his best-known successes is the acclaimed concert cycle of Beethoven's 32 Sonatas. This performance features Piano Sonata No. 10 in G major, Op. 14, No. 2. Typically, this piece is performed within fifteen minutes. While it is not as well known as some of the more unique-sounding sonatas of Beethoven's early catalogue, such as the Path√©tique or Moonlight sonatas, Donald Francis Tovey described it as an 'exquisite little work'. This recital was recorded in March 2019 at the Fazioli Concert Hall in Sacile.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200602/1410020661-Beethoven-piano-sonata-no-10-op-14-no-2</w></i><x></x></a>
