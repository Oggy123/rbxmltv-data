After Hallam brutally slays four deer hunters, FBI Special Agent Abby Durrell turns to L.T. Bonham - the one man who may be able to stop him. At first L.T. resists the mission. Snug in retirement, he's closed off to his past, the years he spent in the Special Forces training soldiers to become skilled murderers. But when he realizes that these recent slayings are the work of a man he trained, he feels obligated to stop him. Accepting the assignment under the condition that he work alone, L.T. enters the woods, unarmed and plagued by memories of his best student. Furious as he is with his former mentor for ignoring his pleas for help, Hallam knows that he and L.T. share a tragic bond that is unbreakable. And, even as they go into their final combat against each other, neither can say with certainty who is the hunted and who is the hunter.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200418/1390407380-The-hunted</w></i><x></x></a>
