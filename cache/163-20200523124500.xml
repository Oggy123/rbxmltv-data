Rocky has little time to bask in his glory, however. He quickly learns that his boxing career has left him with irreparable brain damage and his fortune, which he had entrusted to his dimwitted brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), has been squandered by an incompetent accountant. Deeply in debt to the Internal Revenue Service, Rocky is forced to sell all his possessions, including his mansion. Rocky, his wife Adrian (Talia Shire), and son Rocky, Jr. (Stallone's real-life son Sage), move back to his old neighborhood in seedy South Philadelphia. Adjustment to the dramatically different lifestyle proves to be most difficult for Rocky, Jr., who quickly becomes involved with a bad crowd. Meanwhile, financially desperate Rocky is tempted to re-enter the ring when shady, flamboyant promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) offers him a huge sum of money to defend his title. Adrian, however, is adamant that Rocky not risk his life by returning to the ring. Rocky's future looks bleak until he is approached by a young boxer named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison), who idolizes the champ and begs him to help him train. Rocky agrees to the arrangement and the heat is on.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200523/1400494635-Rocky-v</w></i><x></x></a>
