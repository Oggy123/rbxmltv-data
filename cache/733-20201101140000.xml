He leads us through the mountains of Kascar, an unknown region in southeast Turkey a few kilometers inland from the shores of the Black Sea. In these Turkish villages, people live a very simple way of life, one that reminds Abele of his childhood growing up in the Aosta Valley. In fact, he had been drawn here by this feeling of authenticity and, since, has regularly explored the surrounding valleys by ski. A snowy journey to discover Turkeyâ€™s hidden treasure.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20201101/1460171342-Pathfinders-turkey-the-lost-valleys-of-kascar</w></i><x></x></a>
