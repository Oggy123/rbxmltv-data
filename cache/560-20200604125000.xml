He graduated with Honorable Mention and continued his piano studies at the Accademia Pianistica of Imola. Throughout his career, he has had the privilege of performing as a soloist under the baton of outstanding conductors, among the likes of Gustav Kuhn and Yuri Temirkanov. His acclaimed performances include recitals and concertos for piano and orchestra in many prestigious concert halls. One of his best-known successes is the acclaimed concert cycle of Beethoven's 32 Sonatas. This performance features Piano Sonata No. 15 in D major, Op. 28. The sonata is also known as Beethoven's &quot;Pastorale&quot;. It has been debated whether this title refers to the sense of countryside and nature (the 6th symphony pastoral sense), or to its sense of calm, simplicity and lightness. Beethoven's publishers had a tendency to name his sonatas without consulting Beethoven himself, so it would be impossible to track the meaning back to its origin. This recital was recorded in March 2019 at the Fazioli Concert Hall in Sacile.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200604/1410021879-Beethoven-piano-sonata-no-15-op-28</w></i><x></x></a>
