Like his album of the same name, 'Diagnostic', this concert offers more classical jazz than usual, even if some compositions do show the traces of Oriental and Baroque sounds that have become his trademark. Maalouf is joined on stage by Laurent David on bass, Francois Delporte on guitar, Xavier Roger on drums, Frank Woeste on Fender Rhodes, and Youenn Le Cam on flute, trumpet and bagpipes.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200524/1400293513-Istanbul-sessions-ibrahim-maalouf-diagnostic</w></i><x></x></a>
