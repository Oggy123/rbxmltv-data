O'Day's horn-based approach to singing is in full effect throughout both shows including stand-out renditions in each show of audience favorites &quot;Tea For Two&quot; and &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; (both reprised from her triumphant appearance at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.) This show is a fitting testimony to one of jazz music's true originals and shows unequivocally why she is ranked in the top tier of vocalists along with Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and Billie Holiday.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200603/1410021810-Anita-oday-live-in-sweden-1963</w></i><x></x></a>
