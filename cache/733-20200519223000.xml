Together with Mike Maric, born in Rovigno dâ€™Istria and world record holder in apnoea, we explore the underwater sea beds, small very green islands and picturesque towns. But above all we visit the Brionian archipelago, and a National Park, of rare beauty, that in a very special way unites nature and different animal species and unexpected vegetables. Underwater, in apnoea, we swim over a field of Pinna nobilis or Noble Pen Shells, we enter underwater tunnels and caves with their magical light beams and finally we visit, at about 28 to 40 metres underwater the &quot;Baron Gautch&quot; a steam-boat that was shipwrecked in 1914, which is still quite well preserved.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200519/1400313737-Around-the-world-in-80-islands-a-sea-of-marvels-croazia</w></i><x></x></a>
