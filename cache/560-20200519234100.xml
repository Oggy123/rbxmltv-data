He has also received several distinctions, both as maestro and as a TV personality. With his first album, Solo, in 2015, recorded entirely on solo piano, his remarkable talent as a melodist was revealed to the world. In 2016, he released 'Ensemble', partly recorded with the Czech National Symphony Orchestra. The record shot to 1 in the Portuguese charts. The new album III was recorded in two stages: in Berlin all the piano parts were recorded with the Grammy-winning producer and engineer Tobias Lehman; in Oporto they were recorded with his stage band. The record was mastered in New York by Grammy-winning engineer Joe Laporta and released in Portugal by Universal on the Deutsche Grammophon label in November 2018. A tour is already planned for 2019 coinciding with the international release of III.
