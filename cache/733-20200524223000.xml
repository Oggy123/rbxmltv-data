A decade or so later, under the global downturn, the economy barely flinched. Yet, despite the strong strides the economy has made, little has changed to the fate of the man on the street. Millions in Indonesia still live in the throes of poverty. Aside from bringing democracy to Indonesia, Reformasi also created conditions for a brand new style of doing business in Indonesia. It is an environment where small and medium enterprises can thrive.
