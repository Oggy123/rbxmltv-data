The instant they hit the stage, the warm energies, vibes and grooves of the 1970s come alive, albeit infused with modern influences. The band's vintage, feel-good acid jazz brings out the best in vocalist Evelyn Kallansee. Soaring background vocals, driving percussions, and a heavy horn section lift the music to glorious new heights. Reminiscent of bands like Toto, Tower of Power and Snarky Puppy, or even classic acid jazz acts such as Incognito and The Brand New Heavies, Tristan's energetic grooves and intricate compositions lend the band its own special blend.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200522/1400267429-Tristan-the-heavy-horns</w></i><x></x></a>
