2006. Benny Golson. LRS Media Studios, Chicago, Unites States</k><d>With the exception of DJAZZ.tv, there is hardly any jazz on television. Jazz pianist and broadcaster Ramsey Lewis has addressed this vacuum with his programme series 'Legends of Jazz'. This interesting series brings together musicians who are not usually paired. Almost more than any other instrument, the tenor seems to be able to encompass all infinite shades of jazz. Veteran sax man Benny Golson (who has performed with Lionel Hampton, Dizzy Gillespie and Art Blakey); and Chris Potter, the fiery young horn player who has performed with everyone from the Mingus Big Band to Steely Dan; as well as rising young star Marcus Strickland play individually and together and talk about their lives in music and influences such as Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Sonny Rollins, Coltrane and Stan Getz. The legendary Benny Golson's tenor saxophone performance demonstrates that he is quite at home playing with the young lions. Chris Potter, the ever dependable innovator, and the surprisingly fresh Marcus Strickland gave us performances to remind us that jazz continues to be in good hands.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190820/1310324421-Legends-of-jazz-the-tenors</w></i><x></x></a>
