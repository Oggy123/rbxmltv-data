TAXI TO ASIA is the first travelogue to tap the lively personalities of these informal ambassadors with their huge personal treasure trove of tested tips and tricks to get around Asia's most dynamic destinations. But cabbies are also representative of a city's working class and following them allows us to better understand the common manâ€™s pains and hopes.
