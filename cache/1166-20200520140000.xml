Born in Buenos Aires and still living there, the city has always been his muse. And this is apparent every time Mederos plays the bandoneon, be it fronting one of his many ensembles or as a soloist, just the man and his instrument. The sounds of his bandoneon are like musical images of life, like a journey through the corners and times of his native city. Mederos is a child of the modern age, yet constantly aware of his roots. Hundreds of tourists come to Buenos Aires to explore the tango – a genre that has long spread all over the world. Rodolfo is now 65 and at the prime of his career. His struggle for the tango – the lonely campaign of a man and his bandoneon – continues. The future remains uncertain the only road open is straight ahead. The audience – today's and tomorrow's – is already waiting.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200520/1400201047-A-different-way-rodolfo-mederos</w></i><x></x></a>
