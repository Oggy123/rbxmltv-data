When Hal's ex-girlfriend shows up at the Metropolis High homecoming game and goes love-ballistic as the villain Star Sapphire Jessica begins to second-guess her own nonviolent tactics.</k><d>The world may know them as Wonder Woman, Supergirl and Batgirl, but not-so-typical teenagers Diana, Kara and Barbara — alongside their Super Hero friends — have much more to deal with than just protecting the citizens of Metropolis from some of the most sinister school-aged Super Villains of the DC Universe.

But add super powers and a secret identity to the mix, and things can get a lot more complicated.
