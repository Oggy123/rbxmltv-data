Today the scientific community has begun the ambitious task of mapping the human epigenome to dig further into the complex but essential understanding of gene regulation and transformation. This film takes us right into the scientific odyssey which completely changes our view on how our genes function and what affects them, deeply transforming our understanding and relationship to the ever-changing process of all things Living.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200422/1390342192-Epigenetics-the-hidden-life-of-our-genes</w></i><x></x></a>
