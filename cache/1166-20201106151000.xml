Composer and pianist Jérôme Beaulieu, double bassist Philippe Leduc and drummer William Côté met during their college years at the Université de Montréal. Their Trio Jérôme Beaulieu quickly made a name for itself, winning the Montreal contest Jazz en Rafale and the Grand Prix du Festi-Jazz in Rimouski within the same year. Since their 2012 debut album L'homme sur la lune was nominated for the Opus Prize for Jazz Album of the Year, the trio has been praised for its musical experiments and its contemporary jazz repertoire. The trio's music boasts wide-ranging musical influences: from acoustic music enhanced with electronic rhythms and textures, to a palette of diverse textures accented with samples, eccentric percussion, effects and prepared instruments. With unabated musical enthusiasm yet under the new name Misc, the trio launched its self-titled third album in 2016.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20201106/1460050334-Misc-jer-me-beaulieu-live-in-montreal</w></i><x></x></a>
