Performing in bebop and cool jazz groups, he popularized bossa nova in America with the hit 'The Girl from Ipanema'. In the summer of 1983, Getz brought his working quartet to the Robert Mondavi Winery, Napa Valley, California, for a set that included Over The Edge, Answer Without Question, Sippin' At Bells, Tempus Fugit, and a bossa nova medley of Desafinado and The Girl From Ipanema. Getz (tenor saxophone) is joined by bassist Marc Johnson, drummer Victor Lewis, and pianist Jim McNeely.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20201106/1460050335-Episode-4-stan-getz-jazz-greats</w></i><x></x></a>
