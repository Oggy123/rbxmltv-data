The repertoire for this instrumental combination was non-existent at the beginning, so its members decided to promote a project with different composers, with the intention of creating a new repertoire. Today, Zukan has commissioned, revised and released more than a dozen pieces by national and international composers such as: María Eugenia Luc, Mikel Chamizo, Isabel Urrutia, Francisco José Domínguez, Vassilis Filippou, etc. The group is one of the most consolidated groups on the contemporary music scene in the Basque Country. They have performed in Quincena Musical Donostia, Bernaola Festival, Musikagileak Circuit, BBVA Cycle and Attacca Basel, among others. In this concert from the 2019 edition of Classical:NEXT!, Maria Zubimendi (accordion), Gorka Catediano (percussion) and Jon Ansorena (txistu) perform the works &quot;X. Otaolea&quot;, &quot;Gravity&quot;, &quot;F. Rzewski&quot;, as arranged by Trio Zukan, &quot;To the Earth&quot;, &quot;Seis miradas sobre&quot; and many more.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201104/1460228183-Classical-next-2019-trio-zukan</w></i><x></x></a>
