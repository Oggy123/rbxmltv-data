1988. Herbie Hancock. MÃ¼nchner Klaviersommer, Munich, Germany</k><d>Three giants of jazz join forces in this memorable concert: pianist Herbie Hancock, vocalist Bobby McFerrin, and saxophonist Michael Brecker. Recorded live at the Munich Philharmonie on July 15, 1988, the Herbie Hancock Trio is joined on stage by Michael Brecker, who was maybe the most influential tenor saxophonist of his generation. While the audience is already wowed by the quartet's performance, vocalist Bobby McFerrin steals the show: with obvious enjoyment and sense of humour, the master vocalist challenges his partners.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190817/1310284473-Hancock-meets-bobby-mcferrin-michael</w></i><x></x></a>
