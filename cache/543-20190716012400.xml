The Californian indie rockers performed a slick, soulful, grown-up set at Regency Ballroom in support in support of &quot;Dear Miss Lonelyhearts.&quot; Dipping into newer tracks such as rollicking electro stomper 'Miracle Mile' and raw renditions of fan favourites like 'We Used To Vacation' and 'Hang Me Up To Dry', the Kids showed us they are more than capable of putting on a phenomenal live performance that can keep everyone in the house rocking until the final minute.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190716/1300146988-Cold-war-kids-love-at-the-regency-ballroom</w></i><x></x></a>
