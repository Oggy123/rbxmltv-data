This concert opens with a piano transcription of Astor Piazzolla's La Grande Tango, which was originally composed for piano and cello. After this energetic performance, Burmester plays Chopin's beloved First Ballade, Op. 23. Laginha joins again for two interesting two-piano transcriptions of impressionistic works: Debussy's Prélude &quot;A l'apres-midi d'un faune,&quot; and Maurice Ravel's &quot;La valse.&quot; The duo close the concert with two more encores: Arthur Benjamin's &quot;Jamaica Rumba&quot; and &quot;Rosa&quot; by Pixinguinha. This concert is recorded at the Grand Auditorium of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation of Lisbon, in 2018.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200416/1390145926-Pianomania-pedro-burmester-mario-laginha</w></i><x></x></a>
