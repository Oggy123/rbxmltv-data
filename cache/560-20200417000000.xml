Interestingly, much like its predecessor, the first performance of the opera was received with some hostility, but the work soon became popular throughout Italian theaters and beyond. The opening of La Cenerentola is one of the most famous Rossini pieces, evoking a spirit of lightness and freshness. The work's originality lies in the violent contrast between the heroin's tenderness and the plot's sentimentalism mixed with Rossini's virtuosity and unbridled sense of humor. This 2015 performance of La Cenerentola at the Opéra de Rennes is conducted by Darrell Ang and features the Symphonic Orchestra of Brittany and choir of the Opéra de Rennes and José Maria Lo Monaco, Daniele Zanfardino, Marc Scoffoni and Bruno Pratico.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200417/1390155866-Rossini-la-cenerentola</w></i><x></x></a>
