2006. Fr√© Desmyter. Eurocam Media Center, Lint, Belgium</k><d>In this DJAZZ Belgium Sessions performance, which was recorded at AED Studios in Lint, Belgium, we witness Europe's finest jazz musicians at work. A wide variety of international jazz musicians give a creative, up-close and inside insight into their art of playing jazz music. Young talent and established jazz musicians play to their heart's content: take for instance this unusual performance by the Free Desmyter Quartet. Desmyter is an obstinate improviser with a very original and recognisable sound. His compositions are never contrived, nor revolutionary, for that matter, yet they are contemporary and innovative.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190819/1310312862-Belgium-sessions-free-desmyter</w></i><x></x></a>
