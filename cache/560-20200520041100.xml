It portrays extraordinary composers who were active in the cultural city of Vienna and deserve the label of genius. In Cherchez la Femme (Part 4) we follow the lives and works of Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms.

As Brahms grew to maturity, his nights were in dance halls and Inns. Schumann was the son of an intellectual, with little interest in music. Schumann's crippling mental condition certainly had a strong role in his death. Was Schumann's mental anguish heightened by the ever-deepening relationship between his wife Clara and his friend Brahms? Although Brahms died a bachelor, he considered Clara his true love.
