This concert featured the Berliner Philharmoniker performing live at the ancient Herodes Atticus Theatre along with an interesting combination of conductor and soloist - Sir Simon Rattle wielding the baton as pianist Daniel Barenboim plays Johannes Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1. The Athens concert marked a double premiere: it was the first Europakonzert under the direction of the new chief conductor, as well as the first time Rattle and Barenboim appeared together. The Odeon of Herodes Atticus, an amphitheatre built in 161 AD in memory of Herodes Atticus' wife, is situated on the slope of the Acropolis. With a seating capacity of at least 5, 000 spectators, it was reputed to be the finest theatre in all of Greece.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200602/1410020657-Brahms-piano-concerto-no-1-op-15</w></i><x></x></a>
