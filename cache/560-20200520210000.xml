In this performance by the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra, Boulez displays his masterful understanding of 20th century music as he traces the revolutionary harmonic development of musical modernism in three key &quot;modern classics&quot;: Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, &quot;Prelude&quot; (1859), Arnold Sch√∂nberg's Pelleas und Melisande (1903), and Alban Berg's Violin Concerto (1935). The Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra was founded through conductor Claudio Abbado's initiative in 1986. It consists of musicians under the age of 26 from all over Europe. The soloist in Berg's Violin Concerto is Akiko Suwanai, the youngest first-prize recipient (1990) in the history of Moscow's International Tchaikovsky Competition.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200520/1400191420-Pierre-boulez-conducts-modern-classics</w></i><x></x></a>
