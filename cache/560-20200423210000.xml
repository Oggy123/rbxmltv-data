The ballet is inspired by the air and the dreams of Gaston Bachelard, a French philosopher. 'Pneuma' literally 'Breath of Life' in ancient Greek is a luminous work full of dreamlike images immersed in the haunting music of Gavin Bryars. The wind is everywhere on the stage, in the herbs of the decor, in the fluidity of the clothes and the hair of the dancers. The twenty-two performers go from white to black, alternately floating and whirling like dervishes, in an epic and hypnotic poetry. The music is played by the Orchestre national Bordeaux Aquitaine under the baton of Pieter-Jelle de Boer.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200423/1390289974-Pneuma</w></i><x></x></a>
