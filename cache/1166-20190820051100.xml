Estival offers a thrilling and particularly surprising line-up that explores the rich world of contemporary music whilst promoting the understanding of different cultures, tolerance, and co-existence. The Crusaders, an American jazz fusion group that was popular in the '70s employed a two-manned front-line horn section. The group's sound was rooted in hard bop, with an emphasis on R&amp;B and soul. Their performance at Estival is beyond soulful and an amazing show to watch.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190820/1310324423-The-crusaders-estival-lugano-1987</w></i><x></x></a>
