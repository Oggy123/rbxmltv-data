2014. Joris Roelofs. Zeeland, The Netherlands</k><d>1977 saw the recording of an audiovisual project that was hitherto unparalleled in Dutch jazz and television history: the 'Zeeland Suite'. Pianist Leo Cuypers composed this suite, parts of which were recorded for television on different locations in the Dutch province of Zeeland. A 7-piece band, featuring Willem Breuker and members of his Kollektief, performed Cuypers' music. The combination of live music and epic footage, some of which was filmed from a helicopter, was the basis for a 50-minute television broadcast. Jeroen van Vliet's 'Zeeland Suite Revisited' is an updated version of this remarkable project. Pianist Jeroen van Vliet, 2014's Boy Edgar Prize winner, composed new music. Using a new band – and new technology: drones – this new project once again shows the beauty of Zeeland. Today's band features many big names from the contemporary Dutch jazz scene, gathered to pay tribute to Zeeland's characteristic landscape.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190821/1310335963-Jeroen-van-vliet-zeeland-suite</w></i><x></x></a>
