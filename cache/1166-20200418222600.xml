The quintet has adapted the music's traditional format by pairing a front line of clarinet and flute with a swinging, tightly-knit rhythm section of piano, bass and drums. Yet its sound never strays far from the roots that inspire it ... the soulful Yiddish vocal and dance music. With a repertoire of original compositions and traditional works varying from infectious dances and poignant love songs to exuberant folk melodies and melancholy ballads. Kol Simcha always engages the mind, tickles the heart and nourishes the spirit.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200418/1390175396-Jazz-meets-klezmer-the-kol-simcha-world-quintet</w></i><x></x></a>
