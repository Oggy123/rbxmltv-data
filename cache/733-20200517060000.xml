This group sings the joys and sorrows of the immigrant - relating the story of Argentine songwriter and pianist José Maria Gianelli, who arrived in Canada in 1972. His songs are beautiful and committed. His catchy melodies and his texts unveil a rare beauty, particularly in Spanish. José Maria Gianelli’s music borrows rhythms of Rio de la Plata (Argentina) and the jazz phrasing and lyricism of French songs. His beautiful melodies are carried by the singer Silvia Sundberg and accompanied with finesse and style by Argentine guitarist Osvaldo Rabuńal.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200517/1400313651-In-concert-jose-maria-gianelli</w></i><x></x></a>
