2015. Tim Kliphuis. Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</k><d>The Netherlands Chamber Orchestra commissioned violinist Tim Kliphuis, internationally known for his genre-crossing approach to music, to write a new version of Antonio Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons'. Kliphuis choose to take improvisation as his starting point; at the same time, he intended to leave the best-known Vivaldi themes and chords in, as they give the piece its wonderful energy. The result is a fresh and exciting interpretation that never loses sight of the original. Each season has a different character: the freshness of spring is reflected by the use of Irish and Norwegian traditional music; the summer heat can be heard in the American jazz and funk rhythms; the autumn includes a galloping safari hunt in South-Africa and the ice-cold winter warms up with the energy of Russian gypsy music. For each movement, Kliphuis has a metropole in mind which he visited on his previous concert tours. You're about to witness a truly genre-crossing spectacle!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190816/1310273256-Tim-kliphuis-and-the-nco-the-changing</w></i><x></x></a>
