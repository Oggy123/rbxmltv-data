Brahms' Ein Deutsches Requiem, Op. 45, reaches out to comfort the living through religious texts not traditionally associated with the Requiem Mass. The result is a work of great intensity that speaks to people of all faiths, believers and non-believers alike. The program's two soloists – Hanna-Elisabeth Müller and Simon Keenlyside – are already at home on the world's stages. While the former has carved a career for herself not only as an opera singer but also as a concert artist, the London-born Keenlyside has been building his impressive career around the prestigious guest appearances he has made during the past ten years.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201103/1460228171-Brahms-a-german-requiem-op-45</w></i><x></x></a>
