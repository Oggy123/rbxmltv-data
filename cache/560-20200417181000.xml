Set in the magnificent St Patrick's RC Cathedral, choirs from all over the island of Ireland and further join in a unique evening of music and spoken word. Nowhere is the commemoration of Saint-Patrick more meaningful as in the city of Armagh in Northern Ireland, where Saint Patrick built his first stone church. From this city, all along the Saint Patrick's pilgrimage trail to Downpatrick, there are many sights connected to his life. In the cathedral that bears his name, an evening with music and entertainment is presented to celebrate Saint Patrick. The concert and film, which featured choirs, musicians and performers from the North, South, East and West of Ireland, takes viewers on a journey through Saint Patrick's former home via songs and musical pieces from both religious and secular traditions, showcasing not only the cathedral but also the landscapes of Armagh and Ireland's Ancient East.</d></p><i><t>ZÃ¡bava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200417/1390155891-Celebrate-st-patrick-2018</w></i><x></x></a>
