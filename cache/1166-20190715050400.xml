2018. Jacobo Velez, Sergio 'Checho' Orobio, Roger Torres &amp; Fabio 'Mifa' Lucumi. Music Meeting Festival, Nijmegen, Netherlands</k><d>The latin music orchestra, La Mambanegra, combines many musical elements, such as Jamaican or Colombian music, as well as Funk and Hip Hop. Yet, their main musical influence comes from 1970s New York, where during the time Salsa was born. The magic of the genre, however, is given new colours by La Mambanegra: with a series of fantastic adventures in Cali, La Habana and New York, the band's music is inspired by an anonymous and even mythical hero of the Cali's popular neighborhood Barrio Obrero. Consisting of 8 talented musicians, La Mambanegra presents their charming showcase at the Music Meeting Festival in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190715/1300237140-La-mambanegra-music-meeting-festival</w></i><x></x></a>
