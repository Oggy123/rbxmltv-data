2015. Eddy King, Bernardo Luiz, Fabrice Thompson &amp; Jef Calmard. Le Reservoir, Paris, France</k><d>The term &quot;jam-session&quot; was coined in the 1920s when black and white musicians gathered in smoke-filled bars after their respective concerts to enjoy the kind of jazz they could not play in traditional sets. Bing Crosby was a regular at these sessions, and had fun marking the first and third beats of musical phrases by clapping hands, which the musicians call &quot;jammin 'the beat&quot;. Today, the Seine Sessions are bringing back the happy years of &quot;jam sessions&quot;, while the best of the jazz, blues, gipsy, and funk Parisian scenes occurs on the boards of the legendary restaurant and jazz club Le RÃ©servoir. This episode, hosted by Eddy King, Sally Zemour, and Virgile Aiana features performances of Brazilian music performed by artists playing together for the first time, and interviews with Bernardo Luiz, Fabrice Thompson, Sophie Rakotomalala, and many others.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258182-Seine-sessions-brazil</w></i><x></x></a>
