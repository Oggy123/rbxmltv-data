It has to go in there, this has to be a song.” Every song has its own story, and we all think it’s a story we’ve heard before, but we haven’t. Songbook finds and captures these intriguing stories by pulling you into the process of writing and composing. Known for its pristine sound, cinematic 4k video and eye for detail, Songbook live-captured episodes emphasize the paramount importance of quality. It addresses the on-the-spot elements of blending song and location at the right moment. Both the magical location and remarkable music interaction will get the attention they deserve. Simply because Songbook isn’t just a live music session, it lives. This episode of Songbook features an intimate performance of The Entrepreneurs' lead vocalist Mathias Bertelsen. Complete with guitarist Anders Hvass and drummer Jonas Wetterslev, the Copenhagen-based trio creates a unique modern sound, blending elements of noise, punk, grunge and post-rock. After the 2016 release of Tony Rominger, the band's debut album Noise &amp; Romance, released in February 2019, received critical acclaim for a sound true to title.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200604/1410046465-The-entrepeneurs-songbook</w></i><x></x></a>
