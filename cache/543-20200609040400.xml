An innate desire to travel, to meet people and to do the unexpected has become a calling card of sorts as fans the world over join their community and fall in love with their consistently evolving music. This film follows the band and their latest set of collaborators as they travel across uncharted territory playing the major cities of South Africa with an eclectic mix of musician friends. They explore the craft of song writing and the people, events and influences that dictate that. WE WROTE THIS YESTERDAY showcases the band at their most open and collaborative as they relish the excitement of playing to crowds in new cities whoâ€™ve never seen them before. Along the way they set a fresh challenge for themselves; taking their collaborative culture one step further as they attempt to write and record a mini album in just 2 days, with the other musicians on tour. The filming of this process not only lifts the lid on the art of song writing in an unforced and natural way but captures the journey and story as a group of artists collide, bringing references, ideas and musical styles from Senegal, Sweden, Malawi, Cape Town and London. By exploring South Africa its influence seeps into their musical collaboration.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200609/1410087180-We-wrote-this-yesterday</w></i><x></x></a>
