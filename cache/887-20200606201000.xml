Why not take a virtual break and cycle with us through the beautiful countryside of Japan? On these trips we discover some unique ways of life you only find on the outlying islands.</k><d>Selected moments from past trips to Japan's smaller islands, exploring their unique cultures and ways of life. Riding a scenic cycling route spanning the Seto Inland Sea, we learn how an island community's hopes for the future rest on the students of their tiny school. On the Oki Islands off Japan's west coast, we stand atop its awesome cliffs before getting hands-on in an island sumo ring, and on southern Miyakojima, we taste the ocean in the local tofu and the island's history in its traditional music.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/nhk-world-tv/20200606/1410419163-Cycle-around-japan</w></i><x></x></a>
