The club will not accept any more members than those 27, but a little boy strives to become one of them. Little Giacomo has absorbed &quot;everything Verdi&quot; and he is ready to stand the test. Yet, there is a fly in the ointment: He can only join the chosen few, if one of the existing members will pass away. This is a gripping, witty and suspense-packed story that will teach you a lot about Verdi along the way. Starring Irene Carra, Pietro Anelli, Noa Zatta, Ettore Scarpa and Giacomo Anelli. Directed by Mateo Zoni in 2017.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201102/1460228145-Gruppo-appassionati-verdiani-we-love-verdi</w></i><x></x></a>
