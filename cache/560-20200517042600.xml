The program features Ravel's complete song cycle Don Quichotte a Dulcinée and Rautavaara's Sydämeni laulu. Followed by Brahms' Wie bist du, meine Königin, Op. 32/9 and four songs by Punkeri's compatriot Sibelius: Jägargossen, Op.13/7, Den första kyssen, Op. 37/1, Im Feld ein Mädchen singt, Op. 50/3 and Vilse, Op. 17/4. Founded in 2002, the CMIM is an annual event that draws thousands of spectators to concert halls, as well as listeners on the radio and the web. The competition seeks to discover and support musicians who demonstrate exceptional mastery of their art. It's the only international competition in North America to be held annually and to present three disciplines (voice-violin-piano) in a three-year rotation.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200517/1400148630-Cmim-semi-finals-tomi-punkeri</w></i><x></x></a>
