Shocked by the injustice, the little girl decides to launch a bird restaurant open for all birds regardless of size or pecking order. The Guanos of course have other plans and are already plotting to raid the restaurant. Pat however is keeping a close eye on the seed stock, and intends to repel the pigeonsâ€™ forays by any means necessary to ensure food security for all.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/boomerang/20190821/1310171019-Pat-the-dog</w></i><x></x></a>
