While snooping, Andrews stumbles onto a plot to kill the US ambassador. With the help of friendly female contact Kim-chinh (Kieu Chinh), he escapes from terrorist kidnaper Professor Yen (Vic Diaz) and tries to prevent the ambassador's murder by a French double agent (Danielle Aubry). The only point of interest in this tepid espionage actioner (aside from the glimpse of early Reynolds) is that some of the footage was actually shot in Saigon just as the American presence began to intensify. But even with authentic locations, the story is just too stock to maintain much interest. Dully directed by Christian Nyby, OPERATION CIA is further evidence for film &quot;auteurists&quot; that &quot;producer&quot; Howard Hawks really directed the excellent science-fiction film THE THING (1951) and gave his protege Nyby the credit.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20190816/1310241699-Operation-c-i-a</w></i><x></x></a>
