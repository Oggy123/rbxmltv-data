The world-renowned North Sea Jazz Festival is recognized for its coverage of a wide variety of genres, from traditional New Orleans jazz, swing, bop, free jazz, fusion, avant-garde and electronic jazz, to blues, gospel, funk, soul, R&amp;B, hip hop, worldbeat and latin. Entrepreneur and jazz fan Paul Acket was the founder of North Sea Jazz Festival. In 1975, after he sold his highly successful pop magazine publishing house, Acket was able to organize the first edition of the North Sea Jazz Festival. The first edition of the festival was held in 1976 in The Hague and featured simultaneous concerts in six concert halls by circa 300 musicians, with approximately 9.000 visitors in attendance. Since then, North Sea Jazz Festival has been building on its worldwide reputation as an annual event that presents the past, the present, and the future of jazz.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200420/1390238993-North-sea-jazz-archive-dexter-gordon</w></i><x></x></a>
