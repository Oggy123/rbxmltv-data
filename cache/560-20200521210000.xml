The art of improvisation that is spearheaded by Christina Pluhar and their musicians in the contemporary classical music scene is also the art of all jazzmen. In this jam session of the most original kind, the voices of soprano CÃ©line Scheen, tenor Vincenzo Capezzuto and the viola culminate in a musical experience that offers an all new experience for the listener. And thanks to the Mei Hong Lin's innovative choreography, it is a delight to the viewer alike. Christina Pluhar and Arpeggiata illustrate the timelessness of the music of Henry Purcell by applying the improvisational freedom of jazz to his music in this astonishing concert-ballet. Recorded at Landestheater Linz in Austria, in November 2017.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200521/1400209294-Music-and-dance-for-a-while</w></i><x></x></a>
