They have had four UK No.1 albums and none of their albums have charted lower than No.3. 2003 saw Jamiroquai's third appearance on the Montreux stage. The band deliver a blistering two hour plus set crammed with hit singles and much loved album tracks led from the front by Jay Kay's charisma, movement and compulsory headgear.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200519/1400287718-Jamiroquai-live-at-montreux-2003</w></i><x></x></a>
