TeoTronico can read musical scores in digital or MIDI format, playing them on the piano in a literal way. Accompanied by the Italian pianist Robert Prosseda the robot performs at the Teatro Sociale, Castiglione delle Stiviere, Italy.</k><d>TeoTronico is a pianist robot, conceived and designed by Matteo Suzzi at TeoTronica company, an Italian start-up based in Imola. Version 1.0, with 29 fingers, was completed in 2007. Starting from version 3.0 (2012), TeoTronico was implemented with 53 fingers made of dynamically driven electromagnets, able to control the gradations of any acoustic piano. TeoTronico can read musical scores in digital or MIDI format, playing them on the piano in a literal way. It is also able to reproduce the piano roll recordings - converted into MIDI - of the great pianists of the past. Since 2017, TeoTronico is also equipped with feet for the control of the sustain pedal of the piano. In 2012, TeoTronico made his debut as a soloist at the Philharmonie in Berlin with the Berliner Symphoniker in a special family concert. TeoTronico has performed more than 50 shows with Roberto Prosseda in their unique format 'Robot Pianist Vs. Human Pianist', appearing in the most important Italian concert venues and halls in Europe and Asia. This concert is filmed at the Teatro Sociale, Castiglione delle Stiviere in Italy.</d></p><i><t>ZÃ¡bava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200605/1410022138-Teotronico-the-robot-pianist</w></i><x></x></a>
