2018. Hugh Coltman, Frédéric Couderc, Jérôme Etcheberry &amp; Jerry Edwards. Jazz a Ramatuelle, France</k><d>Hugh Coltman started at blues-rock band The Hoax, after which he moved to Paris, where he released two albums in the folk and pop genres. Soon he got drawn into the jazz scene and recorded a tribute to Nat King Cole. For his album &quot;Who's Happy?&quot; he travelled to New Orleans. Since then, &quot;Who's Happy?&quot; is no longer a big question in life, but also a big question in music. At Jazz a Ramatuelle, we witness why this amazing singer was elected &quot;La voix de l'année' at Les Victoires du Jazz 2017. With his songs, he displays his warm voice full of emotions and melancholy. He's supported by Frédéric Couderc (clarinet and bariton), Jérôme Etcheberry (trumpet), Jerry Edwards (trombone), Didier Havet (sousaphone), Freddy Koella (guitar), Gael Rakotondrabe (piano), and Raphael Chassin (drums).</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190717/1300253335-Hugh-coltman-jazz-a-ramatuelle</w></i><x></x></a>
