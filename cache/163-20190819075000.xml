The cops pressure her to help them bring down Ordell, threatening prison if she refuses. With a sympathetic bailbondsman, who understands her restlessness only too well, Jackie arrives at a bold almost foolhardy plan to play off these opposing forces against each other. Matters are complicated by Ordell's confederates, Louis Gara and Melanie Ralston who have agendas of their own. By appearing to cooperate with both sides, Jackie attempts to outfox them both and walk away with a half million dollar payday.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20190819/1310241740-Jackie-brown</w></i><x></x></a>
