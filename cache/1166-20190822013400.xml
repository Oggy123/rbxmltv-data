2013. Misha Mengelberg. The Netherlands</k><d>Misha Mengelberg, the forgetting has begun. He is waiting for a taxi he didn't call to go to a performance that won't take place. Dutch composer/pianist and grand duke of jazz Misha Mengelberg (1935) has been submerged in the shadow of dementia, ending his life as a musician. At the London jazz club Vortex in 2013 he impressively says his goodbyes to the international stage. It's also his last major performance with his band, the Instant Composers Pool Orchestra. The musicians find it hard to let him go, but Misha's decline is constant, and he slowly fades away from their midst. A film about exceptional loyalty, dilemmas, respect and dedication. And about music, the music of Misha Mengelberg.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190822/1310367564-Misha-enzovoort</w></i><x></x></a>
