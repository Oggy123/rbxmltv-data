As a tougher-than-nails escapee from Hell with a shady past, Cage's character, the mysterious Milton, races through an apocalyptic desert wasteland in pursuit of a Satanic cult led by Twilight's Billy Burke who murdered his daughter and kidnapped his daughter's child. With only three days to track down the infant and destroy the devil-worshippers, Cage's Milton drives the fastest, toughest muscle cars he can steal. In homage to the great spaghetti westerns and 70s grindhouse gems, 3D purist filmmaker Patrick Lussier (My Bloody Valentine) loses the seatbelts and lets the engines rev, the explosions blow and the blood splatter. With Zombieland's Amber Heard as a kick-ass waitress who knows her way behind a steering wheel and a ten-gauge, and The Dark Knight's William Fichtner as a fiendish &quot;Accountant&quot; sent to recapture Cage and balance Beelzebub's books, this blood, guns and gasoline grindhouse doesn't let up for a second.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200418/1390407367-Drive-angry</w></i><x></x></a>
