1998. Michel Petrucciani Trio. Stuttgart, Germany</k><d>This 1998 recording features the late French pianist Michel Petrucciani and his trio of drummer Steve Gadd and bassist Anthony Jackson in performance in Stuttgart. The musicians might seem an unlikely team. Petrucciani (who died in January 1999) was an unabashed romantic in the lyrical piano tradition that extends from Duke Ellington through Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett, while Gadd and Jackson are best known as masters of the contemporary studio groove. Yet they achieve an organic sense of swing, even if Jackson's bass guitar lacks the rich wooden timbre of an acoustic instrument.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190822/1310367574-Michel-petrucciani-trio</w></i><x></x></a>
