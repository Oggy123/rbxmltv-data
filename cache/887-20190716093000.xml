But is fishing the only thing on their minds?</k><d>In a corner of a major industrial zone on Tokyo Bay sits a park from which people can fish at any time of the day or night.

Among the people who come to drop a line in the water are a shipyard worker from the Philippines, a freelance illustrator hoping to catch a big fish with her brand-new fishing rod, and a young man who has worked in construction since he was a teenager to support his family and dreams of becoming a photographer.
