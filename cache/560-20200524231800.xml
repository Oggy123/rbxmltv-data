The young lady Antonia LÃ¼tzow, for whom he wrote his Piano Concerto No. 8, was not a very accomplished performer, but in all its simplicity, this concerto is seldom short of sublime. In this episode, soloist Christian Zacharias performs Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 8, K 246, accompanied by the Radio-Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart and conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti. The concert took place in Schwetzingen palace, where the Mannheim Elector's court spent their summers.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200524/1400282796-Mozart-piano-concerto-no-8-k-246</w></i><x></x></a>
