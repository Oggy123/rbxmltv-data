Bing Crosby was a regular at these sessions, and had fun marking the first and third beats of musical phrases by clapping hands, which the musicians call &quot;jammin 'the beat&quot;. Today, the Seine Sessions revive the happy years of &quot;jam sessions&quot;, while the cream of jazz, blues, gipsy and funk Parisian scenes occurs on the boards of the legendary restaurant and jazz club Le RÃ©servoir. Entitled &quot;Hip-Hop Jazz,&quot; this episode hosted by Eddy King features unique performances by artists playing together for the first time, and interviews with DjeuhDjoah, Lieutenant Nicholson, Kacem Wapalek, and many others.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200606/1410026414-Seine-sessions-hiphop-jazz</w></i><x></x></a>
