Vaering's songs possess a timeless quality with their gracefully swung melodies, while they are truly modern at the same time with their 'in your-face' approach to catchy hook lines and the largely groove-based arrangements. The music balances intelligently between being clever and being emotional. It is executed brilliantly by some Europe's finest baroque musicians of the Barokksolistene ensemble. Vaering is a remarkable vocalist who masters both the intensely fragile and the more powerful nuances. She is complemented by a pianist whose exquisitely tasteful playing builds on the great Scandinavian piano tradition, adding a pinch of Swedish folklore, pop music and free jazz. In combination with Trinelises unvarnished voice, the unique timbre of the baroque instruments, the vibrato-less sounds, and the 'on the beat' approach to groove, the music is far removed from the usual romantic setting of sweet pop songs. This music has edge, and is performed with engrossing vitality.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200519/1400182397-Oh-purity-in-watching-landscapes</w></i><x></x></a>
