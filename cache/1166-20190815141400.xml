2006. Dave Brubeck. LRS Media Studios, Chicago, Unites States</k><d>With the exception of DJAZZ.tv, there is hardly any jazz on television. Jazz pianist and broadcaster Ramsey Lewis has addressed this vacuum with his programme series 'Legends of Jazz'. This interesting series brings together musicians who are not usually paired. Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, Oscar Peterson, Bud Powell, Count Basie and Duke Ellington are just some of the piano legends under discussion by two pianists who are venerable legends themselves - Dave Brubeck (1920-2012) and Dr. Billy Taylor (1921-2010). The reputations of these two great legends are widely known and respected. Here they show us why. These two 85-year-old masters put on an incredible show in both solo and duet numbers, and offer fascinating reminiscences.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258176-Legends-of-jazz-the-piano-masters</w></i><x></x></a>
