It has to go in there, this has to be a song.” Every song has its own story, and we all think it’s a story we’ve heard before, but we haven’t. Songbook finds and captures these intriguing stories by pulling you into the process of writing and composing. Known for its pristine sound, cinematic 4k video and eye for detail, Songbook live-captured episodes emphasize the paramount importance of quality. It addresses the on-the-spot elements of blending song and location at the right moment. Both the magical location and remarkable music interaction will get the attention they deserve. Simply because Songbook isn’t just a live music session, it lives. This episode of Songbook features Dutch singer-songwriter Flaws, who is known for his heartfelt alt-pop sound and his self-tought mixing skills, full of contrast and balance. At only two EPs and several singles out, the Utrecht-based Daan Havenith already celebrated successes with two San Holo collaborations, both having gathered millions of streams. The 2017 release &quot;I Still See Your Face - Flaws Remix&quot; was followed by &quot;voices in my head - Flaws remix&quot; in 2019. The success of the song, a gig at legendary Amsterdam Dance Event and the release of his first music video surely made the last year Flaws' best one yet. He kicked off a bright-looking 2020 with a new single, and the release of his session with Songbook. Watch him perform and walk you through the meaning behind &quot;All We Are&quot; and &quot;Mindspeak&quot; at the Wijngaard Dassemus in the Dutch city of Chaam!</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20201106/1460092234-Flaws-flaws-songbook</w></i><x></x></a>
