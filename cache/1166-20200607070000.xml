The man who popularized Brazilian music all over the world with his Stan Getz collaboration Jazz Samba in 1962, plays an intimate New Orleans club date with his trio, consisting of his brother, Joe Byrd, on the bass, and Chuck Redd on drums. Byrd manages to make his nylon-stringed Spanish guitar sound like an electric hollowbody, while he applies his acoustic classical guitar techniques to jazz and popular music. The trio covers a range of material written by the old jazz masters Duke Ellington and Fats Waller, but also bossa nova classics by Jobim: &quot;Corcovado&quot; and &quot;Wave&quot;. This broadcast offers the first part of the performance.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200607/1410030658-Charlie-byrd-trio-1</w></i><x></x></a>
