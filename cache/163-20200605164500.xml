In his immediate family and in his office, they surround him. He is loving and giving to each and every one at all times--he is their savior and would have it no other way. And as in the story of Job, one day a higher force decides to test his faith. Once a man in complete control of his universe, Dr. T now finds himself surrounded by chaos and confusion. The doctor of choice for the city's society elite, Dr. T is steadily losing ground to his overbooked scheduled. His home life starts to boil over with his zealous wife planning their daughter's wedding. Adding to the chaos, Dr. T's champagne-loving sister-in-law Peggy has moved in with her three kids. Overwhelmed, Dr. T begins spending more time at his country club's golf course, adding a new woman to his life--an easy-going golf pro. This burgeoning affair further adds to the whirlwind of confusion surrounding him.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200605/1410331613-Dr-t-and-the-women</w></i><x></x></a>
