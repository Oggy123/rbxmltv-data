The city of Salzburg, Mozart's birthplace influenced his peripatetic life. He hated the city and despised working for the Archbishop of Salzburg as a servant, a musical servant writing only for the pleasure of the Archbishop. In 1777, he left for Paris to find a new job, but his stay was no gaîté Parisienne. He received few job offers and his beloved mother, who had accompanied him, became violently ill and died. In a Salzburg Festival performance, the Mozarteum Orchestra and pianist Mitsuko Uchida, under the baton of Jeffrey Tate, play Piano Concerto No. 9, KV 271. This piece was nicknamed &quot;Jeunehomme&quot; but was composed for Victoire Jeramy, the daughter of Mozart's friend, dancer and choreographer Jean-Georges Noverre.</d></p><i><t>Seriál</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201030/1450506264-Mozart-on-tour-episode-6-paris</w></i><x></x></a>
