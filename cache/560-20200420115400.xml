The work was almost completely written in the summer of 1889 in Dvořák's house in Vysoká, South-East of Prague. The symphony is in great contrast with the composer's famous Ninth &quot;From the New World&quot; Symphony. The Eighth is an overall triumphant work of extroverted joviality, dedicated to outdoor life. Classical symphonic forms are combined with Bohemian folk tunes, clearly showing Dvořák being at the peak of his symphonic creativity. This rendition is recorded in the Berliner Philharmonie and directed by Claus Viller.</d></p><i><t>Zábava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200420/1390227960-Dvorak-symphony-no-8-op-88</w></i><x></x></a>
