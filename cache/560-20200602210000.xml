This work bears witness to an introspective thought about faith, written in honour of the city of Jerusalem, for soloists, choir and orchestra, with libretto taken from Old Testament. For expressive purposes, Penderecki uses specific instruments: the tubaphone, percussive objects designed by the composer himself, and the shofar, an ancient Jewish liturgical instrument. Soloists for this performance include Iwona Hossa (soprano), Karolina Sikora (soprano), Anna Lubanska (mezzo-soprano), Adam Zdunikowsk (tenor), Piotr Nowacki (bass) and David Švehlík (speaker). Also featured in the programme is a rendition of the &quot;Serenade for Orchestra&quot; by Czech composer Isa Krejci. Recorded at Smetana Hall in Prague, Czech Republic.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200602/1410020662-Penderecki-symphony-no-7-7-gates-of-jerusalem</w></i><x></x></a>
