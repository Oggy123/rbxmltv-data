She looks in her dad’s ornithology book and finds out the bird is actually a parrot. Lola wants to take a photo of the bird and turn it into a star in her school. But the Guanos are jealous and want to be in the spotlight. They kidnap the bird and disguise themselves as parrots. But in vain - Lola is no fool. She's only interested in the real parrot. Pat will have to free the bird from the pigeons’ grasp and help his best friend get the perfect picture.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/boomerang/20200416/1390020152-Pat-the-dog</w></i><x></x></a>
