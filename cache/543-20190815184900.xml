It includes tracks from &quot;All Things Bright And Beautiful&quot;, alongside songs from &quot;Ocean Eyes&quot; and the self-released debut album &quot;Maybe I'm Dreaming&quot;. Owl City is the creation of Adam Young, a Minnesota native who started making music at home and building up a fanbase via the internet before breaking worldwide with his global hit &quot;Fireflies&quot; in the summer of 2009. The single went to No.1 in both the US and the UK and many other countries. Adam Young has developed from a shy musician operating out of his bedroom into a confident and dynamic live performer and this concert in front of a wildly enthusiastic young audience proves just how good he and his band can be.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190815/1310109092-Owl-city-live-from-los-angeles</w></i><x></x></a>
