Kung Fu Kitchen is an action-packed culinary adventure series delving into the highly disciplined cooking techniques of some of Asia's best-known specialties. From knife-juggling in Japanese teppanyaki to the contorting acrobatics of kung fu tea in China, professional chefs are stretched to their limits under the stern and traditionally exacting standards of their. The art of serving Kungfu Tea is a visual spectacle that incorporates a long spouted brass kettle and strong elements of martial arts in its acrobatic serving method. Add to the fact that the kettle contains piping hot water (making it difficult to handle) and that not a single drop is allowed to be spilt outside the teacup when serving customers; one can understand why it takes years to fully master the numerous Kungfu moves involved in pouring a simple cup of tea. Gabriel Carillo, a freelance bar-tender originally from Buenos Aires, but now based in Beijing wanders into the backstreets of Hangzhou to discover how this particular long-spout pouring technique was born out of tea-brewing rigours and the influence of the Chinese literati and teahouse entertainment. With the simplest strokes requiring 3 months to perfect, will Gabriel pick up the skills in under 3 days to impress his master?</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200420/1390342155-Kung-fu-kitchen-kung-fu-tea-hangzhou-china</w></i><x></x></a>
