The musicians might seem an unlikely team. Petrucciani (who died in January 1999) was an unabashed romantic in the lyrical piano tradition that extends from Duke Ellington through Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett, while Gadd and Jackson are best known as masters of the contemporary studio groove. Yet they achieve an organic sense of swing, even if Jackson's bass guitar lacks the rich wooden timbre of an acoustic instrument.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20201104/1460050281-Michel-petrucciani-trio</w></i><x></x></a>
