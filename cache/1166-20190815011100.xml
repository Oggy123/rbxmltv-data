2016. Emile Parisien, Joachim Kühn, Simon Tailleu &amp; Mario Costa. Jazz a Ramatuelle, France</k><d>Since his first appearance at Jazz in Ramatuelle in 2010, saxophonist Émile Parisien has made his mark among the most talented musicians of his generation. On the soprano saxophone, his favorite instrument, he invented a unique lyrical style. As part of his participation in the 2016 edition of Jazz a Ramatuelle, Parisien invited two European jazz legends to join his ensemble: the German pianist Joachim Kühn (1944) and the legendary multi-instrumentalist Michel Portal (1935). Over 80 years old, the latter is an incomparable saxophonist, clarinetist and bandoneonist, a musical adventurer who skilfully combines jazz, classical music and film music. Guitarist Manu Codjia, bassist Simon Tailleu and drummer Mario Costa complete the sextet conducted by Parisien, who delivers a memorable performance at Jazz in Ramatuelle.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258165-Jazz-a-ramatuelle-parisien-meets-k-hn</w></i><x></x></a>
