Riding high on the release of their second record ‘The Only Place’ (rated #14 in Rolling Stone’s end of year poll), indie vixen Bethany Cosentino, guitarist Bobb Bruno and band surged through their set of DIY hits like ‘Boyfriend’, ‘The Only Place’ and ‘Do You Love Me Like You Used To’. The endless summer starts now… enjoy the show!</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20201105/1460085906-Best-coast-live-at-the-metro-theatre</w></i><x></x></a>
