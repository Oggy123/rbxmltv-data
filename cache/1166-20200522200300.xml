Hanna is joined by super bassist George Mraz, &quot;Sir&quot; Roland Hanna, and drummer Marvin Smith, and two Basie-ites named Frank: Frank Wess, and, as special guest, his more robust-toned namesake, Frank Foster. These veterans of the Count Basie Band are featured in a superbly swinging set of straight-ahead jazz originals. This broadcast from Duke's Place offers the second part of the performance.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200522/1400267436-New-york-jazz-quartet-live-in-the-french-quarter</w></i><x></x></a>
