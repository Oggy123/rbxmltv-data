1964. Dionne Warwick. 27 Club, Knokke, Belgium</k><d>Dionne Warwick's vocal artistry ranges from voluminous deep register to soft, fragile high notes. She masters the entire range with almost unnerving ease. But more than her strong, warm voice, Dionne's magic is in the silky elegance and the secure delivery with which she tells a story. That's how her, along with composer Burt Bacharach and lyricist Hal David become pioneers of the brand of pop music called &quot;Middle of the Road&quot;, meaning pop that is grippingly simple, but never trite. Sixty of her hits made it into the American charts and sold over 100 million albums worldwide. This amazing 1964 recording from the 27 Club in Knokke, Belgium showcases the 23-year-old star vocalist at the start of her career.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258171-Dionne-warwick-live-at-the-27-club</w></i><x></x></a>
