Lintu studied piano and cello at the Sibelius Academy and the Turku conservatorium in Sweden's southeast. He started conducting at the Sibelius Academy. His many concerts with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra in 2012 made him the obvious replacement for Sakari Oramo, who, after many years as conductor and concert master, terminated his contract in 2012. The orchestra specializes in the performance of Finnish music, but also performs the great masterpieces of Gustav Mahler and Béla Bartók. The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius is the orchestra's favourite, as well as the conductor. In cooperation with Finland's national public broadcasting company Yle, all seven Sibelius symphonies are recorded and broadcast. After a brief spoken introduction about the piece, the orchestra performs the complete symphony. While composing his Symphony No. 5, Sibelius was also sketching his Symphony No. 6, using a number of ideas he could not fit in his No. 5 for No. 6. The music is based on modal lines, which are often used in church music. His Symphony No. 6 has few melodic lines and a slightly gloomier atmosphere. For that reason, Sibelius added the description 'When shadows lengthen' to the title.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200520/1400191409-Sibelius-symphony-no-6</w></i><x></x></a>
