2011. Saul Williams, Denis Teste &amp; Tahiti Boy. Catacombs, Paris, France</k><d>In 2014, the musician Saul Williams had a very specific idea: to create a film under the city, in the &quot;real&quot; catacombs of Paris, those that are illegal and difficult to access. Accompanied by his team, Williams went underground. In this unusual recording, his voice echoes in the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of underground Paris, and his improvisations are powerful like a sermon. Saul Williams is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, musician, slam poet, writer, and actor known for his mix of alternative poetry and hip-hop.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190822/1310367580-Une-soiree-de-poche-saul-williams</w></i><x></x></a>
