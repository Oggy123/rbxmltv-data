It used to be the number one honeymoon destination and the standard location where professional baseball players went to practice during the off season, but honeymoons were taken overseas and practice locations were taken by Okinawa Prefecture, and its foreign visitor rate hangs low at 39th place in Japan. Something must be done! So, we gathered 8 foreigners living there.
