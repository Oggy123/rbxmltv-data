This 1992 live set from Mahogany Hall is no different. Together with her band mates Franker Parker III on trumpet, Donald Provost and Joseph Saulsbury on saxophone, pianist Mark Adams, guitarist Guillermo Ladut, bassist Paul Boudreaux, and drummer Wilbert Widow, Irma Thomas gives songs like &quot;Bill Bailey&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman&quot; her inimitable treatment. The singer's powerful voice demonstrates once again that time truly is on her side. Yes, it is!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200604/1410022111-Irma-thomas-soul-queen-of-new-orleans</w></i><x></x></a>
