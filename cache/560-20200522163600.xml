This 1992 performance, directed by Bernhard Haitink, includes the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the Tölzer Knabenchor, and the Ernst Senff Choir. During the six parts of this wonderful symphony, Mahler expresses his musical vision of nature and mankind's place in it. Much like he did in his second symphony, Mahler incorporates some of his song cycle Des Knaben Wunderhorn. The fourth movement ends with a magnificent solo for alto, inspired by a poem by Friedrich Nietzsche, played here by Florence Quivar, and the fifth movement concludes with a male choir. The third symphony originally consisted of seven movements, but Mahler eventually chose to cut the seventh part, which he then used as the last movement for his fourth symphony.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200522/1400256907-Mahler-symphony-no-3</w></i><x></x></a>
