He took the opportunity with both hands and wrote his First Violin Concerto. De Sarasate, at his young age, was already a celebrity and he performed all over the world. Saint-Saëns, who like many French composers of the Romantic period was very interested in Spanish folk music, wrote another piece for the young violin legend four years later: 'Introduction et Rondo Capriccioso' for violin and orchestra. This piece not only contains elements of several Spanish dances, but Saint-Saëns also deliberately made it difficult to play. He wanted to present the violinist, who had grown up in the meantime, with a challenge. De Sarasate was very pleased with the result and performed the piece on a regular basis, with popularity ensuing: both George Bizet and Claude Debussy made their own versions.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200420/1390227957-Saint-sa-ns-introduction-et-rondo-capriccioso</w></i><x></x></a>
