Today, outdoor traveling has to be meaningful and incorporate values of sharing and caring. PATHFINDERS follows these new travelers whose quest for adventure and open spaces is equal to their respect for the locals. With them, you will discover magical places but also the daily concerns of their inhabitants. Whether surfing in Peru or cycling downhill Mount Kenya, they are being confronted to the ecological threat facing Lake Titicaca or the terrible droughts hitting southern Kenya. Outdoor tourism has evolved beyond the landscape. Attention to local people and ecosystems while at the same time enjoying the world's most desirable locations is the new bent in outdoor travel. This episode of PATHFINDERS takes us to Peru where a family of windsurfers from Hawaii has come to investigate a rumor that places the origin of surfing in this Andean country. They will discover a beautiful country inhabited by a wonderful people which, unfortunately, is confronted to an environmental threat, especially at Titicaca, the highest lake in the world.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200524/1400313884-Pathfinders-surf-peruvian-style</w></i><x></x></a>
