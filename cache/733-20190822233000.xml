However, Shanghai paints a starkly different picture. Ageing faster than Japan, a third of its people could be over 60 years ld in just 10 years time. Although already China's most populous city, Shanghai is in need of more babies. In a bid to solve the problem of acute labour shortages and strains on medical and welfare systems in the near future, there has been a gradual rollback of the one-child policy. Couples who meet the strict criteria are allowed t have a second child. But are they able t afford the various cots that come with having a second child? The rat race in Shanghai already begins at the age of a toddler. With MBA programs for juniors, young children are prematurely thrown into the adulthood. With a schedule as packed as an adult's, no room is left for a healthy childhood. Having over 40 branches of FasTracKids schools in Shanghai alone, it is clearly a reflection of the hunger for an early head start for children. Brought up in a generation that adhered strictly to the one child policy, will the mindset of its people change? Will parents be able to cope with the pressures accompanied with a second child? Is this an effective solution to solving Shanghai's problems?</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20190822/1310163773-The-asian-century-shanghai-s-two-children-policy</w></i><x></x></a>
