Violinist Vadim Repin, who at the age of 17 became the youngest winner of the violinist section of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition 1987 in Brussels, is specialized in interpreting works of Russian composers. Together with renowned pianist Nikolay Lugansky, he brings to the stage a performance of prestige and virtuosity. The programme features Debussy's Sonata for Violin and Piano in G-minor (L 140), Ravel's Sonata No. 2 for Violin and Piano in G-major, Beethoven's Sonata No.9 in A-major, Op. 47. It is produced by the Moscow Philharmonic Society, which Saint Petersburg-born composer Dmitri Shostakovich himself once described as playing a significant role &quot;in the development of musical life [in Russia]. It is a kind of university which is attended by millions of music lovers and thousands of musicians.&quot; The Moscow Philharmonic Society was founded in 1922 by then-Commissar for Culture, Anatoly Lunacharsky, and has over the years come to be Russia's leading concert organizing institution.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200605/1410022140-Violin-sonatas-debussy-ravel-beethoven</w></i><x></x></a>
