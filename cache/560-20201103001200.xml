In this work, every character is illustrated by a different instrument (or section), with its own musical theme. Peter, for example, is represented by the strings, his grumpy grandfather by the bassoon, the cat by the clarinet, and the bird by the flute. As the narrative progresses and the characters interact with each other, the musical themes beautifully entwine. This performance (2018) is narrated and conducted by Marin Alsop. The musical accompaniment is provided by the Britten-Pears Orchestra.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201103/1460228163-Prokofiev-peter-and-the-wolf</w></i><x></x></a>
