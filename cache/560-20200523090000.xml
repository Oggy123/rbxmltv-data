The program opens with Schubert's An Sylvia (D. 891), La mort d'Ophélie (H. 92A) by Berlioz and Abschied von Frankreich and Gebet from Schumann's Gedichte der Königin Maria Stuart, Op. 135. Osowski continues with Robert Fleming's song cycle The Confession Stone (Songs of Mary), after which she concludes the final, performing Schubert's Die junge Nonne D. 828 and A Prayer to Saint Catherine by Virgil Thomson. Founded in 2002, the CMIM is an annual event that draws thousands of spectators to concert halls, as well as listeners on the radio and the web. The competition seeks to discover and support musicians who demonstrate exceptional mastery of their art. It's the only international competition in North America to be held annually and to present three disciplines (voice-violin-piano) in a three-year rotation.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200523/1400271527-Cmim-finals-clara-osowski</w></i><x></x></a>
