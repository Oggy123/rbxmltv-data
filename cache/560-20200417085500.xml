Mozart composed the work in 1778, during his unsuccessful job-hunting time in Paris. The opening movement of the &quot;Paris&quot; symphony is one of the grandest and most thrilling sounds Mozart ever made from an orchestra. The composer used the clarinets for the first time in a symphony, having heard the new instrument earlier in Mannheim. With horns, trumpets, timpani, and a full section of woodwind with flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons, it is the biggest orchestra the composer had used until then. This broadcast is directed by JÃ¡nos Darvos.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200417/1390155876-Mozart-symphony-no-31-k-297</w></i><x></x></a>
