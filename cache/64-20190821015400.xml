The distraught Lola hurries out to look for her kitten, followed by the prankster. But Pat figures the situation out and outsmarts Tank to get closer to the kitten. However, with the Guanos determined to use the opportunity to rid themselves of the innocent kitten, Pat's rescue bid becomes increasingly complicated. Our hero's resilience should never be underestimated though.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/boomerang/20190821/1310170898-Pat-the-dog</w></i><x></x></a>
