Mozart admired the horn player's skill but also liked making fun of him. He for instance wrote on Leutgeb's manuscript: &quot;W. A. Mozart took pity on Leitgeb, ass, ox and fool in Vienna on 27 May 1783.&quot; He would also, for example, deliberately instruct the orchestra to play 'allegro' (lively, fast) where Leutgeb's score said 'adagio' (slowly, at ease), which undoubtedly caused some confusion. Leutgeb does not seem to have minded the teasing much and the two were very close friends. When Mozart's wife Constanze was away for a few days in 1791, the composer even stayed over at Leutgeb's house, because otherwise &quot;I would have been all alone at home, which would not have been pleasant&quot;.
