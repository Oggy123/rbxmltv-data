He created the groundbreaking N - E - R - D group, which made a mix of rock, funk and hip hop, released his first solo album &quot;In My Mind&quot; in 2006 and definitely consecrated himself with his second album, &quot;Girl&quot;, released in 2014. But it was the presentation at the traditional Glastonbury festival in 2015 that became the consecration and summary of Williams' career. &quot;The crowd did not stop singing my song, I performed twice,&quot; said Pharrell; This was his debut at Glastonbury as a solo artist with a hit set on the Pyramid Stage; Had previously played the festival as a member of their N - E - R - D group, but this time, thousands sang their famous hits, including Frontin, Gust of Wind and Lose Yourself to Dance, in a fun show where British girls climbed on stage to dance a medley from his former group. In addition to his own successes, he played tracks he produced, such as Gwen Stefani's 'Hollaback Girl', Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' and Snoop Dogg's 'Drop It Like It's Hot', not to mention the 'Get Lucky' With Daft Punk. A historical and complete show that enshrines an artist who points out the trends of the future of pop music !</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190715/1300146982-Pharrell-williams-live-at-glastonbury</w></i><x></x></a>
