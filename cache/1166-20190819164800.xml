1993. Don Menza. New Orleans, U.S.A.</k><d>Legendary hardbop pianist Cedar Walton's super trio of bassist Tony Dumas and drummer Ralph Penland is joined by two stellar veterans of the great Stan Kenton's band: tenor saxophonist Don Menza (yes, the father of Megadeth's drummer Nick Menza!) and trumpeter Sam Noto, today a mainstay on the Canadian music scene. In this broadcast, these gentlemen play a straight-ahead jazz set in which Menza has plenty of room to bring his legendary command of circular breathing into practice, and in which drummer Ralph Penland shows us just why exactly Gil Scott-Heron, Marvin Gaye, and Ahmad Jamal were all so very keen to hire his services.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190819/1310312873-Buffalo-sax-hero-don-menza-in-new</w></i><x></x></a>
