Hosted annually in Bremen, Germany, it brings together musicians, bookers, agents, organizers, jazz experts, and music enthusiasts. In 2019, jazzahead! pays special attention to Norway by selecting 40 jazz acts from all over the world and inviting them to perform over the course of three days. One of them, Belgian reed player Mattias De Craene invites his two compatriots Simon Segers and Lennert Jacobs on bizarre instrumental adventures. Segers and Jacobs are both experienced drummers from the worlds of jazz, pop, free improvisation, and experimental music. At times, their music brings about a dark, horror-like atmosphere, followed by unwieldy, repetitive tribal rhythms.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200523/1400280593-Mdciii-jazzahead</w></i><x></x></a>
