2017. Chris McQueen, Jason &quot;JT&quot; Thomas, Henry Hey &amp; Kevin Scott. Paard, Den Haag, The Netherlands</k><d>Forq is an instrumental quartet with an aggressive sound and a penchant for sonic exploration. Originally founded by keyboardist Henry Hey (David Bowie, Empire of the Sun, and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts) and bassist Michael League (Grammy-winning founder of Snarky Puppy), Forq is joined by guitarist Chris McQueen and drummer Jason &quot;JT&quot; Thomas. Their group sound draws from various musical paths of its members, whether it's Jason's swampy grooves and shuffles, Chris' singular sonic approach to guitar, Henry's zeal for unique keyboard sounds and twisted ear candy, or Michael's driving world-influenced grooves. The band pushes further down the sonic rabbit hole with their stunning music. This concert was filmed during Mondriaan Jazz Festival 2017, The Hague.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190716/1300244149-Mondriaan-jazz-2017-forq</w></i><x></x></a>
