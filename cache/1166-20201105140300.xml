This must have been the reasoning of the organizers of the Festival International de Jazz Adolphe Sax in Dinant, Belgium, when they invited tenor saxophone giant Coleman Hawkins to perform there in June 1962. Appearing with a group that includes the French pianist George Arvanitas, one-time Duke Ellington bassist Jimmy Woode, and expat drummer Kansas Fields, the musician also known as 'Bean' and 'Hawk' serves up an hour-long set of familiar standards bookended by Hank Jones' &quot;Chant&quot; and J. J. Johnson's &quot;Wee Dot&quot;.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20201105/1460050308-Coleman-hawkins-live-in-belgium-1962</w></i><x></x></a>
