Not only was Mozart unlucky in love in Mannheim, but he also failed to achieve his ambition of becoming a court composer. The young lady Antonia Lützow, for whom he wrote his Piano Concerto No. 8, was not a very accomplished performer, but in all its simplicity, this concerto is seldom short of sublime. In this episode, soloist Christian Zacharias performs Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 8, KV 246, accompanied by the Radio-Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart and conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti. The concert took place in Schwetzingen palace, where the Mannheim Elector's court spent their summers.</d></p><i><t>Seriál</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200519/1400171906-Mozart-on-tour-episode-5-schwetzingen</w></i><x></x></a>
