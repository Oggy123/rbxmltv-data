He helps fight off an attack led by a ninja and rescues the base commander's daughter, Judie Aronson, for good measure. But after a strained thanks to Dudikoff, her father immediately phones Don Stewart, the local crime czar, to tell him their plan to steal the arms was foiled. Stewart starts making plans to get rid of this new annoyance. Meanwhile, back at the base, Dudikoff explains to his new friend Steve James that he has amnesia and doesn't know where he was trained in the martial arts at which he is so proficient. Ridiculous scripting and frequently comical budget limitations make this film a mostly awful trip to Bruce Lee Land, though the fight scenes, choreographed by Mike Stone, a karate champion and former partner of Chuck Norris, are spectacular and not as silly as the usual Hong Kong product. For fans of the genre only.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200420/1390407406-American-ninja</w></i><x></x></a>
