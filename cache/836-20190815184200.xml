Unfortunately when it comes to love and romance, she has found all of her previous relationships to be a bit routine and mundane.

She questions how a man can so easily strip away her inhibitions and replace them with lust and desire. How is it that he has such control over her? Why does she like it so much? Her journey of self-discovery and sexual awakening, however, may come with a price.
