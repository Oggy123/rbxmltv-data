1973. Duke Ellington. Théâtre Marni, Brussels</k><d>In 1956, Duke Ellington and his Orchestra performed a legendary set at the third annual Newport Jazz Festival. It was tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves' outstanding 27-chorus solo on &quot;Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue&quot; that revitalized Ellington's career. The success generated during that performance carried him for the rest of his life. By 1973, festivals carrying the Newport name were organized all over the world. Less than a year before his death, Ellington and his Orchestra, with Gonsalves still in the fold, appeared in Brussels to deliver a timeless performance before a highly appreciative crowd.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190822/1310367572-Duke-ellington-jazz-from-newport</w></i><x></x></a>
