1991. Michael Mossman. Münchner Klaviersommer, Munich, Germany</k><d>Well-known for his exuberant style and intimate familiarity with a vast range of jazz and Latin idioms, Michel Camilo has always had a sixth sense for musical adventure. Camilo was one of the most stimulating jazz pianists to emerge in the mid- to late '80s. His powerful two-handed attack (full of impressive technical skills), his knowledge of both jazz and Afro-Cuban music, and his willingness to constantly take chances turn each of his solos into an adventure. This broadcast was taped during the 1991 Münchner Klaviersommer, when Camilo was playing with his amazing Quintet. He is accompanied by Ned Mann (bass), Cliff Almond (drums), Michel Mossman (trumpet and trombone) and Ralph Bowen (saxophone and flute). Camilo's rise to fame has been swift, and his influences range from jazz musicians like Art Tatum and Keith Jarrett to twentieth-century composers like Debussy and Ravel.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258178-Munich-philharmonic-hall-michel-camilo</w></i><x></x></a>
