Furtermore, Daniil Trifonov (1991) is star soloist in Schumann's Piano Concerto, Op. 54, which was premiered in 1841 by Clara Wieck, wife of the composer. Trifonov rose to fame after winning prizes at both the Tchaikovsky International Chopin competition in Moscow as well as the Chopin International Piano Competition in Warsaw. Trifonov has been called &quot;arguably today's leading classical virtuoso,&quot; and &quot;without question the most astounding pianist of our age.&quot; This concert is recorded at the Grand Auditorium of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation of Lisbon, in 2018.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201101/1460023051-Pianomania-daniil-trifonov</w></i><x></x></a>
