Davenport is persuaded by friend Hamill to flee London with his family. They are invited to hole up on Hamill's well-stocked farm. Davenport and family leave, later joining outlaw May and his wife, Richard. From this point, the film becomes an orgy of violence as Davenport's party must face up to a group of crazed bikers and survive internecine struggles. When they reach the farm, Davenport and company find that Hamill's brother, Holt, will not allow them to join him. Davenport leads an attack on the farm, killing Holt. This potentially powerful material is unfortunately dealt with too melodramatically. An overly conventional script and the confusing use of flash forwards mitigate the suspense the film might have generated, especially during the climactic action sequences. What's more, characters are often merely stereotypes, especially the evil characters. However, there is an arresting bleakness to the ^Imise-en-scene^R that makes this film worth a look. Crops lie destroyed, and fields are littered with bodies of the dead. Significantly, this desolate landscape predates the apocalyptic vision of George Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD. The direction is by Wilde, who starred in numerous swashbucklers during the 1940s and 1950s after being a member of the US Olympic Fencing team.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200517/1400494539-No-blade-of-grass</w></i><x></x></a>
