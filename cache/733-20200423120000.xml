Yet, from the clown fish to the octopus, the lionfish to the cleaner fish, without of course omitting the coral, all these creatures are the essential characters of the riveting marine life theater. But how much do we know of them? With its playful narration and exceptional HD footage, FISH LIFE brings a new vision of this underwater universe. You will discover the secrets of its inhabitants through a profusion of colors, shapes and behaviors which will fascinate the whole family. Oceans take up three quarters of our planet. Its inhabitants need to be mobile to feed and breed, and in this realm of motion there are absolutely no limits. While some swim, others walk, crawl or propel themselves. This episode of FISH LIFE plunges into the world of these sea creatures from the most ordinary to the weirdest, from the most static to the most dynamic, from the slowest to the fastest. They have all invented their own dance of life, dazzling our eyes with the unending show of nature in movement.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200423/1390342239-Fish-life-motion</w></i><x></x></a>
