During his stay in Mannheim, from 1777 to 1778, Mozart made several decisive encounters for his musical development. He discovered the Mannheim Orchestra and its school of composition, which have had a significant influence on his work. The artistic and sentimental life of the young composer was also transformed by his years in Mannheim: it was in the German city that he met the musical copyist Fridolin Weber and his daughters, who had a great influence on him. Mozart immediately fell in love with the youngest, Aloysia; he wrote the role of the Queen of the night of The Magic Flute for the eldest, Josepha; and eventually married the youngest, Constanze. In this episode, Christian Zacharias performs Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 6, KV 238, accompanied by the Radio-Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart under the direction of Gianluigi Gelmetti. This concert was recorded at Schwetzingen palace, where the Mannheim elector's court would spend their summers.</d></p><i><t>Seri√°l</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200518/1400160239-Mozart-on-tour-episode-4-mannheim</w></i><x></x></a>
