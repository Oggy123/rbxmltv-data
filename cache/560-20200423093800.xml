One of the first tasks connected to this admission was to supply the clarinet students with suitable exam pieces. This he did, composing a 'Premiere rhapsodie' for clarinet and piano, dedicated to clarinet teacher Prosper Mimart and first performed at the exams in July 1910. The piece was a great success and, consequently, Debussy made another version for clarinet and orchestra in 1911.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200423/1390289959-Debussy-first-rhapsody-l-116</w></i><x></x></a>
