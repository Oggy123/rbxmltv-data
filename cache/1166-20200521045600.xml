Cannonball Adderley (alto sax), Nat Adderley (cornet), and the masterful Yusef Lateef (tenor sax, flute, oboe), provide a massive three-horn frontline attack, while the stellar rhythm section featuring a pre-Weather Report Joe Zawinul (piano), Sam Jones (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums) fuel the songs with a deep infectious swing. Quincy Jones' &quot;Jessica's Day&quot; leaps from the gate with a huge big band sound that is extraordinary for only six musicians. This recording is a reminder that Cannonball Adderley was one of the most outstanding and highly respected alto saxophonists in the history of jazz. He was a bluesy jazzman who could play anything in superb fashion.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200521/1400219684-J-e-cannonball-adderley-live-in-switzerland</w></i><x></x></a>
