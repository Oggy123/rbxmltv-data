In this broadcast, these gentlemen play a straight-ahead jazz set in which Menza has plenty of room to bring his legendary command of circular breathing into practice, and in which drummer Ralph Penland shows us just why exactly Gil Scott-Heron, Marvin Gaye, and Ahmad Jamal were all so very keen to hire his services.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200419/1390186262-Buffalo-sax-hero-don-menza-in-new-orleans</w></i><x></x></a>
