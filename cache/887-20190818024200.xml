Beautiful seawaters, called &quot;Shakotan Blue&quot;, spreads forth before us. Our program host, Charlotte Kate Fox, explores Cape Kamui, at the tip of the peninsula, with a guide. She walks along the sheer cliffs overlooking the sea, enjoying the unique rocky landscape and seasonal flowers. Later, we show you footage of tiny crabs and fish that find unusual ways to survive in the tide pools along the shoreline.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/nhk-world-tv/20190818/1310762366-Wild-hokkaido</w></i><x></x></a>
