The Russian pianist's recitals are always a highlight of the Verbier festival. Always played to a full house, they are anticipated by the audience. This year was no exception with a programme devoted to Debussy Preludes on the occasion of the centennial of the composer's death and, above all, to Schumann's seldom played Sonata No.3 Op.14. Schumann composed the piece in 1836 but revised it in 1853. Kissin carefully scrutinized both versions and has allowed himself to borrow the best from both. The 30-minute long work is challenging both physically and technically, ending in a spectacular finale.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200602/1410020649-Evgeny-kissin-plays-chopin-schumann-debussy</w></i><x></x></a>
