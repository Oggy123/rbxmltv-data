2016. Scott DuBois. Jazz Club Unterfahrt, Munich</k><d>Rising star of the jazz guitar Scott DuBois leads his quartet, consisting of Gebhard Ullmann (reeds), Thomas Morgan (bass), and Kresten Osgood (drums), in an intimate and atmospheric performance at Munich's Jazz Club Unterfahrt in March 2016. The group's telepathy is such that they are able to go from deathly quiet to fiercely avant-garde at the drop of a hat. For this occasion, DuBois and his group gave a full performance of his &quot;Winter Light&quot; album, released a few months earlier, plus his 'Lake Shore Suite'.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190715/1300237144-Scott-dubois-quartet-live-in-munich</w></i><x></x></a>
