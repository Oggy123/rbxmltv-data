The Monnaie is banking on the exceptional partnership between the conductor Carlo Rizzi and a new arrival, the Polish director, Mariusz Trelinski, for this long-awaited return to the Brussels stage because the opera was last performed there 37 years ago. The opera returns to La Monnaie with an all-star cast: Eva-Maria Westbroek, in the role of Manon, Brandon Jovanovich in the role of Knight Des Grieux, and Aris Argiris as Lescaut.The Symphony Orchestra and Chorus of La Monnaie perform a unique staging of Manon Lescaut.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200601/1410020642-Puccini-manon-lescaut</w></i><x></x></a>
