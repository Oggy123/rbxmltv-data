The program starts off with The Things Our Fathers Loved, In Flanders Fields and Tom Sails Away by Charles Ives and Bleuet (FP 102) and Priez pour paix (FP 95) by Poulenc. These are followed by three Schubert songs: Der Schiffer (D. 536), Der Wanderer (D. 493) and Du bist die Ruh (D. 776). Brancy closes the competition with two works by Rachmaninov: Zdes khorocho, Op.21/7 and Vesennié vody, Op. 14/11. Founded in 2002, the CMIM is an annual event that draws thousands of spectators to concert halls, as well as listeners on the radio and the web. The competition seeks to discover and support musicians who demonstrate exceptional mastery of their art. It's the only international competition in North America to be held annually and to present three disciplines (voice-violin-piano) in a three-year rotation.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200416/1390145920-Cmim-finals-john-brancy</w></i><x></x></a>
