2016. Steve McCraven, Hakim Sulaiman, Piotr Wojtasik &amp; Carl Morrissey. Le Resevoir, Paris, France</k><d>The term &quot;jam-session&quot; was coined in the 1920s when black and white musicians gathered in smoke-filled bars after their respective concerts to enjoy the kind of jazz they could not play in traditional sets. Bing Crosby was a regular at these sessions, and had fun marking the first and third beats of musical phrases by clapping hands, which the musicians call &quot;jammin' the beat&quot;. Today, the Seine Sessions revive the happy years of &quot;jam sessions&quot;, while the cream of jazz, blues, gipsy and funk Parisian scenes occurs on the boards of the legendary restaurant and jazz club Le RÃ©servoir. Titled &quot;Legendary Jazz&quot;, this episode hosted by Eddy King features unique performances by artists playing together for the first time, and interviews with Steve McCraven, Oona Guino, Rodolphe Lauretta, and many others.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190821/1310335955-Seine-sessions-legendary-jazz</w></i><x></x></a>
