Today's broadcast shows a special gathering between saxophone heavyweights Peter King and Steve Grossman. These experienced musicians' trip to the bay amounts to much more than a social call. The quintet, which is rounded out by bass player Duylinh N'Guyen, drummer Stéphane Huchard and pianist Alain Jean-Marie, delivers an amazing show. Although the two saxophonists have an average age of 70, these jazz titans will convince you you're watching young musicians on stage – albeit with 70 years of experience.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200603/1410021813-Mont-saint-michel-steve-grossman-peter-king</w></i><x></x></a>
