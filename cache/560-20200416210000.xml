Set to the unifying theme of Tchaikovski's music, the show reaches heights of emotion. In 2006 the Ballet Biarritz headed by Thierry Malandain captivated Chaillot's audience with Les Créatures. This unusual company – which has a taste for classical body language and remains modern in its approach – will shine again with Magifique. Dipping into personal memories to Tchaikovsky's engrossing music, Thierry Malandain turns in one his most beautiful creations. Thierry Malandain tells how as a kid he used to describe his ecstatic moments as &quot;magifiques&quot; leaving the &quot;n' out. Today, he is still secretly besotted with dance. And that is mag(n)ificent! The Malandain Ballet Biarritz recorded at the Gare du midi, Biarritz in 2009.</d></p><i><t>Zábava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200416/1390145940-Magifique</w></i><x></x></a>
