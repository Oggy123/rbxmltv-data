This fall marks the release of the first two volumes of the series—Fire &amp; Water—while Earth &amp; Air are scheduled for a spring debut. For Thrice, it's the realization of a year-long process of writing and recording, which was done primarily in the band's own studio and engineered by guitarist Teppei Teranishi, without the assistance of an outside producer.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20201105/1460085890-Thrice-live-at-metro-theatre</w></i><x></x></a>
