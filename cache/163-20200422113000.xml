The family's exploits were chronicled again in 1985 in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S EUROPEAN VACATION. This film, written by John Hughes and directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik, follows the Griswolds' wayward attempts to have an old-fashioned Christmas. Starting with a trek to the country to find the perfect Christmas tree and concluding with a SWAT team's intrusion on the Griswold Christmas Eve party, the film is a loud and obvious satire of American holiday traditions, punctuated with innumerable references to Christmas movie classics. Although Chase is very funny, the first half-hour of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION falls flat, and the film doesn't come to life until the arrival of Quaid, who steals the picture. Nevertheless, with enough sight gags to please slapstick fans and enough good-natured Christmas cheer to qualify as a good holiday film, NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION should keep most viewers occupied and provide 97 minutes of goofy entertainment.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200422/1390407426-National-lampoon-s-christmas-vacation</w></i><x></x></a>
