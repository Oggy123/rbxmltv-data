1983. Les McCann. New Orleans, U.S.A.</k><d>Self-taught musician Les McCann became the international jazz superstar he is today after the release of his album &quot;Swiss Movement&quot; which he recorded in 1968 with the late Eddie Harris. Yet there is much more to this musician than that one record. McCann moves comfortably from one jazz style to the next, demonstrating impressive chops in all areas, from bop to fusion, and from vocals to the keys of the electric piano, clavinet, or synthesizer. His mix of church and swing music captures the spirit of the time perfectly, even when an illness prevented him from playing with more than one finger at a time in the early 1990s. In today's broadcast, McCann takes gospel back to New Orleans, where he played this set in 1983. McCann's vocals shine in the soulful performances of several of his hits, including &quot;Just Like Magic&quot;, backed by his wonderful &quot;Magic Band&quot; of saxophonist Bobby Bryant Jr., bassist Curtis Robertson Jr., and drummer Tony St. James.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190820/1310324425-Les-mccann-live-in-new-orleans</w></i><x></x></a>
