The work consists of three choirs and an extensive instrumental line-up, which is of a very festive character. Valls was a contemporary of Bach and was, like him, conductor at various churches. At the same time, Valls was stubborn enough to cause a scandal. In a certain passage of the Gloria (with the text &quot;miserere nobis&quot;) he made a strange harmonic turn, without preparing dissonance. Some of his colleagues were furious, and this excitement is now hard to understand for modern listeners. The performance was recorded at the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw Presentatiekerk in Gent, in 2018.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200524/1400282788-Valls-missa-scala-aretina</w></i><x></x></a>
