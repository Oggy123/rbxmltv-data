1989. Dino Saluzzi, Charlie Mariano &amp; Wolfgang Dauner. Theaterhaus, Stuttgart, Germany</k><d>Dino Saluzzi, one of Argentina's tango music masters, has been building his legacy since the mid-1980s. His accordion-like bandoneon defines Argentina's tango music. Saluzzi has explored many pathsâ€”paths along which he has rarely travelled more than once, despite some common threads. This rare, vibrant and intense performance is an intimate collaboration with Charlie Mariano (saxophone) and Wolfgang Dauner (piano) and features music ranging from tango and classical music to international favorites.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190817/1310284481-Saluzzi-mariano-dauner-live-in</w></i><x></x></a>
