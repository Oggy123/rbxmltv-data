Their music is hardly ordinary: the traditional North-African music style 'tichumaren' is mixed with elements of western pop and rock music. The band members' forefathers, Tuareg, lead a nomadic life in the north-central Sahel. When these nomads looked for shelter in the cities of Northern Africa, their traditional music mixed with the local traditions. In this concert recording, material from Tinariwen's album 'Tessalit' is played. The sight of these Tuareg musicians in their indigo tagelmusts adds an unusual dimension to their desert song.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200603/1410021811-Une-soiree-de-poche-tinariwen</w></i><x></x></a>
