Post-rock, post-jazz and post-minimalism, they shamelessly steal sonic palettes from all areas to build their cinematic sound. This collaborative group features Luke Howard (piano), Fran Swinn (guitar) and James McLean (drums). This strong collection of music-makers each bring their unique voice to the stage as part a united front led by bassist Tamara Murphy.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200420/1390238998-Tamara-murphy-spirograph-studies</w></i><x></x></a>
