It has to go in there, this has to be a song.” Every song has its own story, and we all think it’s a story we’ve heard before, but we haven’t. Songbook finds and captures these intriguing stories by pulling you into the process of writing and composing. Known for its pristine sound, cinematic 4k video and eye for detail, Songbook live-captured episodes emphasize the paramount importance of quality. It addresses the on-the-spot elements of blending song and location at the right moment. Both the magical location and remarkable music interaction will get the attention they deserve. Simply because Songbook isn’t just a live music session, it lives. This episode of Songbook features Italian singer-songwriter Violetta Zironi. The Correggio-born solo artist began writing songs at the age of 16 and found inspiration in country and bluegrass music throughout her musical development. Today, Violetta blends the Mediterranean melancholy conceived through her Italian roots with folk and elements of americana in intimate songs. She is known for a pure sound, often relying on her beautifully soft voice and guitar only.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200519/1400287721-Songbook-violetta-zironi</w></i><x></x></a>
