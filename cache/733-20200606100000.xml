Here we see the huge Mahon harbor, where regattas and sail boat events often take place, in this crystal clear sea the pure waters allow octopus, lobsters and many different species of fish to thrive. On dry land we go and get to know genuine local products, such as delicious liqueurs and some tasty cheese. We then visit the best beaches of Minorca, that are sometimes framed by luxuriant vegetation. Finally we arrive at Fornells, a fishermen village where we manage to taste their typical lobster based dish: Caldereta de Langosta.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200606/1410106632-Around-the-world-in-80-islands-where-nature-is-purest-mnorca</w></i><x></x></a>
