The Bavarian capital of Munich was always one of Mozart's favorite places - it saw important performances of many of his major instrumental works and hosted the world premiere of his monumental opera seria Idomeneo, re di Creta. The first edition of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 26, KV 537, also written for the coronation of Emperor Leopold II in 1790, is remarkable because it doesn't contain all the notes for the solo part. This method prevented the music from falling into the hands of dishonest copyists, but more importantly, it shows that pianists had to improvise the necessary harmonies, sometimes at sight based on musical sketches. Soloist Homero Francesch performs Mozart's Piano Concert No. 26, KV 537 with the Bavarian Radio Orchestra, under the baton of Maestro Wilhelm Keitel. This performance was recorded at Munich's residence.</d></p><i><t>Seri√°l</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200520/1400191411-Mozart-on-tour-episode-12-munich</w></i><x></x></a>
