The police manage to track down one of the thieves, but can't trace who masterminded the theft. So the insurance company sends a beautiful and unscrupulous bounty hunter to collaborate with the detective leading the investigation. Using her own fairly unconventional methods, the beautiful Greta (Greta Martini) approaches various people in the jet-set and after a few failed attempts, pinpoints Terry Caldwell as the probable mastermind. The two embark on a dangerous game of seduction, with the poorly hidden aim of getting the other in the sack. With her charm and bewitching ways, Greta manages to make a breach in Caldwell's heart, making it easier for the police to find the evidence they need to trap him. Caldwell, driven by the desire to surprise her, plans a new hit and leaves Greta with the choice of whether to betray him or have him arrested.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/eroxxx-hd/20190715/1300189861-Gm-affair-the</w></i><x></x></a>
