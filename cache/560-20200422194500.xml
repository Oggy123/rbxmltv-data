He sees himself as an ambassador of French music from the 17th through the 20th centuries as well as an advocate for the art of improvisation. Pieces played in the film are: Pierre Cochereau's Boléro, Louis Vierne's Carillon of Westminster and Scherzo from Symphony No. 2, Alexandre Guilmant's Sonata No. 1, Charles-Marie Widor's Gothic Symphony, Marcel Dupre's Cortege, Litanie and J.
