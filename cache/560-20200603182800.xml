Cho's refined palette of color and superb technical mastery is perfectly suited for revealing the subtle harmonic invention of Images. Schumann's Fantasiestücke, Op.12 are rarely featured in concert programs. This half-hour long cycle is a challenge for the performer who has to demonstrate an extreme versatility of moods ranging from the dark &quot;Des Abends&quot;, the angst-filled &quot;In der Nacht&quot; to the virtuous &quot;Traumeswirren&quot;. With Chopin's Op.58, Cho shows his ability in the grand sonata form and his affinity for the composer that earned him the distinction by winning the First Prize of the 2015 Chopin competition. Recorded at the 2018 edition of the Verbier Festival in Switzerland.</d></p><i><t>Zábava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200603/1410021737-Seong-jin-cho-plays-debussy-schumann-chopin</w></i><x></x></a>
