In this series, the Hammond B3 organ takes centre stage. Rob Mostert invites the world's finest jazz musicians for a musical collaboration, in which the Hammond Organ plays a major role. The Hammond B3 is an electric organ, which generates sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup. Initially, the Hammond B3 was at home in churches, until it entered the jazz scene in the mid-20th century. In this episode, Mostert teams up with the Dallas-born vocalist Dede Priest. She's renowned for her raw sound. She knows how to sing blues and gospel like no other!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200420/1390239000-The-hammonds-sessions-sven-figee</w></i><x></x></a>
