So much so that after a restaurant makes a Bear-Sized Burrito, Grizz can't bring himself to eat such a work of art and so carries it everywhere. / You know that annoying friend who just can't get the hint? That's Charlie, and he's Bigfoot. The Bears meet him when Charlie signs up on a home-sharing website. / The Bears find a bedazzled jean jacket in a dumpster. It’s just about the coolest thing they’ve ever seen and seems to bring luck, until the Bears fight over it. / The Bears open up a food truck after being disappointed by the food options available to them. In an effort to drum up business, they start selling their food to animals.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/cartoon-network-uk/20190819/1310174097-We-bare-bears</w></i><x></x></a>
