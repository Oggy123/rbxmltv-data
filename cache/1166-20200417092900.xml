In this episode of the Visions of Music series, Tito Puente explains the origins of Latin jazz, a trend founded in the '30s and' 40s by Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo. Gillespie has always been inspired by Latin music and tried to combine it with jazz. Tito Puente, nicknamed the &quot;pope of music&quot;, traveled around the world to perform with Latin jazz musicians such as Gillepsie and Pozo. This American songwriter, musician, and producer played timpani and vibraphone. Thanks to Puente, it is now acceptable to play more than two timpani. Indeed, this innovative musician was often seen on stage with seven or eight timpani.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200417/1390162125-Visions-of-music-the-latin-tinge</w></i><x></x></a>
