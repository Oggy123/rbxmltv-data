This youngster has come off second best in a hassle with a hippo and these Animal Doctors will need all their skill to stem the infection in her badly injured leg. It’s a much brighter picture in the rolling English countryside where we meet the old workhorses finally at peace in their own version of &quot;horse heaven&quot; after a lifetime of service. In our Animal Allies &quot;How To&quot;... . who’s a pampered puss? We pass on the message about massage and how this ancient healing art is helping felines enjoy all their nine lives. And in Animal World, you’ll meet a prehistoric-looking creature found in Sydney, Australia. We’ll tell you how Leonardo the alligator snapping turtle’s life almost went down the drain... . Literally.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200608/1410106698-Animal-allies-ii-4</w></i><x></x></a>
