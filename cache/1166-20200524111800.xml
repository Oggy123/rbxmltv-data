Its name 'BIRD' refers to the nickname of the legendary New York jazz saxophonist, bebop co-founder Charlie Parker (1920-1955). BIRD serves Neapolitan pizzas, good wines, no-nonsense beers and an all-round metropolitan rawness. Since 2014, this urban jazz club and DJAZZ.tv have been collaborating for a series of music programmes: 'BIRD.tv', allowing you to experience the best BIRD concerts and interviews as from a first row seat! In this episode, the fantastic artist Quantic takes BIRD's stage. Merging a jazz sensibility with his dancefloor-orientated grooves, deep funk, hard-hitting drums and tropical rhythms, producer Will Holland is one of today's most talented and prolific artists in alternative dance music. Recording under various guises, Holland first found acclaim as Quantic.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200524/1400293505-Birdtv-quantic</w></i><x></x></a>
