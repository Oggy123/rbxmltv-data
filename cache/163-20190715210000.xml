It's been nearly ten years since Krueger invaded peoples' dreams to exact his deadly form of revenge and murder. But now, his memory has been systematically erased by a town determined to put an end to Freddy once and for all. Potential victims have been drugged to prevent them from dreaming, rendering impotent the master of nightmares They've eliminated their fear of Freddy, absolute torture for an egomaniac psychopath who's a legend in his own mind. Like an inmate with a life sentence, Freddy's been reduced to plotting a fantastic revenge that will never happen. Until, that is, Freddy resurrects Jason Voorhees, the equally iconic madman and the perfect means for Freddy to once again instill fear on Elm Street, creating a window of opportunity for him to emerge from his purgatory. Recognizing how easily manipulated Jason is, Freddy tricks Voorhees into journeying to Springwood to start a new reign of terror.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20190715/1300592631-Freddy-vs-jason</w></i><x></x></a>
