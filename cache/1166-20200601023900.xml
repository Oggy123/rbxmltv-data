(2006)</k><d>In this DJAZZ Belgium Sessions performance, which was recorded at AED Studios in Lint, Belgium, we witness Europe's finest jazz musicians at work. A wide variety of international jazz musicians give a creative, up-close and inside insight into their art of playing jazz music. Young talent and established jazz musicians play to their heart's content: take for instance this unusual performance by the Swing Dealers, an ensemble that finds its roots in the swing jazz of the mid-20th century, but at the same time, it is strongly influenced by a more soulful and contemporary sound. The band evolves around saxophonist Vincent Mardens and vocalist/bassist Jean van Lint. The interaction between saxophone and vocals creates a unique and characteristic sound.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200601/1400633996-Belgium-sessions-swing-dealers</w></i><x></x></a>
