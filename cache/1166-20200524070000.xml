Tonight is no exception: in this 1980s concert, Thielemans, the unbeatable winner of DownBeat's most popular artist in the &quot;miscellaneous instrument&quot; category, is joined by the bright young pianist Fred Hersch, whose lyrical playing would in decades to come inspire Brad Mehldau. Together with bassist Harvie Swartz and drummer Adam Nussbaum, the group digs into the Thielemans songbook of classics like &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot; as well as &quot;Ne Me Quitte Pas&quot;. And of course, Thielemans's all-time greatest hit, &quot;Bluesette&quot;, closes his set, as usual whistled in unison with his guitar.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200524/1400293500-Bluesette-toots-thielemans-songbook</w></i><x></x></a>
