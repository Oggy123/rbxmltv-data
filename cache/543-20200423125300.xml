Shot during Morrissey’s most intimate gig in decades at the Hollywood High School in Los Angeles on 2nd March 2013, the film opens with fans talking about their unwavering devotion to the singer and the unique appeal of this unusual venue – a striking contrast to the sold out arena concert at the Staples Center on the previous night. Tickets to the concert in the 1,800-seater school auditorium had sold out in 12 seconds and this now legendary concert became Morrissey’s penultimate performance on the US Tour.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200423/1390461060-Morrissey-morrissey-25-live</w></i><x></x></a>
