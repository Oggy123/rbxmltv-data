2017. Thomas Carbou &amp; Jeff Moran. Quebec, Canada</k><d>Thomas Carbou and Jeff Moran share an almost telepathic rapport, blending spontaneous improvisation, electronic looping, and Brazilian and Indian musical influences to create ecstatic groove pieces and dream-like soundscapes. They use a wide array of instruments, including a custom-built 8-string guitar, cuatro, bouzouki, caj√≥n, frame drums, berimbau, udu, and metal percussion instruments, as well as samplers and laptops, adding their own hypnotic vocals to the mix.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190718/1300321240-Jeff-moran-thomas-carbou-live-a-quebec</w></i><x></x></a>
