Of the major soul-jazz pioneers, he was the bluesiest and often insisted that he was more of a blues musician than a jazz artist. Regardless, he remained eclectic enough to blur the lines of genres. His sound - deep, down-to-earth grooves drenched in blues and gospel feeling - made him popular with R&amp;B audiences. This 1965 performance is part of the Comblain-la-Tour Jazz Festival.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200602/1410020791-Comblain-la-tour-jazz-festival-jimmy-mcgriff-trio</w></i><x></x></a>
