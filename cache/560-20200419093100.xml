Every year, the musicians commemorate the anniversary of the orchestra's founding (May 1st, 1882) and celebrate their heritage from the Old World. The Europakonzert of 1998 was held in a unique location: The Vasa museum in Stockholm which displays a 17th-century ship that capsized and sank during its maiden voyage in 1628. The ship measures 69 meters in length, 12 meters in width, and 1.210 tons in weight. It offers the perfect backdrop for the Berlin Philharmonic. Under the baton of Claudio Abbado, they perform melodies in tune with the maritime surroundings, such as the Overture to Richard Wagner's The Flying Dutchman and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's symphonic fantasia The Tempest. The program also features Claude Debussy's Nocturnes. For the concert's main piece, discover a memorable and powerful impression of Giuseppe Verdi's Quattro pezzi sacri. The orchestra is joined by the Swedish Radio Choir and the Eric Ericson Chamber Choir.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200419/1390176935-Verdi-quattro-pezzi-sacri-iii-laudi-a-vergine</w></i><x></x></a>
