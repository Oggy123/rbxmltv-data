Their debut album &quot;Broken Boy Soldiers&quot; charted at No.2 in the UK and follow up &quot;Consolers Of The Lonely&quot; went in at No.8. Both albums were also Top 10 in the USA. This performance from Montreux in 2008 was part of the tour in support of their second album. The setlist is split between songs from the two albums and includes covers of Terry Reid's &quot;Rich Kid Blues&quot; and the old Charley Jordan track &quot;Keep It Clean&quot;. This is rough, tough rock 'n' roll with great tunes and even better guitar hooks performed by an outstanding live band.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200521/1400408789-Live-at-montreux-2008</w></i><x></x></a>
