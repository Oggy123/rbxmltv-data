The piece is arranged for piano and clarinet by Massimo Berzolla. Ennio Morricone is one of the most successful film composers. He composed music for over 500 films and tv-series and at the age of 86 won an Oscar for his work on Tarantino's The Hateful Eight (2015). This made Morricone the oldest winner of an Academy Award.
