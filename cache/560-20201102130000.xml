This is the final of the composer's short selection of symphonic works. Described by music critic Malcolm Macdonald as one of the &quot;supreme creative acts of the Romantic era,&quot; Brahms' Fourth Symphony is endowed with a strong undercurrent of subdued melancholy. It seems to pine for an irretrievable past. The past lives on majestically in this work, particularly in the sighing theme of the first movement reminiscent of Baroque practice, and, above all, in the use of the Baroque form of the chaconne in the last movement, around which Brahms spins over 30 variations on a solemn, stately theme. This performance was recorded at Severance Hall in Cleveland, USA, in 2014.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201102/1460228153-Brahms-symphony-no-4-op-98</w></i><x></x></a>
