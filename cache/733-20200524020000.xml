The show looks at invasions of aggressive non-indigenous animals around the world. Pacific lionfish are eating their way through the Caribbean, Burmese pythons are infesting the Everglades, African killer bees have worked their way north from Brazil to Utah, Asian carp are now swimming in the millions from New Orleans to Chicago. These and many other &quot;alien invaders&quot; are the villains (and stars!) of our show.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200524/1400313869-Alien-invaders</w></i><x></x></a>
