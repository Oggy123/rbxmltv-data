The work is a transcription by Rudolf Barshai of Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 8, which was composed in only three days (July 12 to 14 1960). The work draws from Shostakovich's pieces, like the Symphonies No. 1 and 5, and a Jewish theme from Piano Trio No. 2. Furthermore, it contains melodies from the first Cello Concerto and the Lady MacBeth opera. Recorded at the Elisabeth Center in Antwerp, Belgium.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200524/1400282793-Shostakovich-chamber-symphony-op-110a</w></i><x></x></a>
