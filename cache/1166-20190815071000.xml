2014. Michel Legrand. Versailles, France</k><d>Take one look at Michel Legrand's extraordinary career, and you start asking yourself the question: 'what have you been doing the rest of your life'? The French composer, songwriter, pianist, born in 1932, has not only produced around 140 film scores, won three Oscars (out of eleven nominations), worked with Miles Davis, composed songs like 'What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life', 'The Windmills of Your Mind' and 'The Summer Knows' – every one of which trigger the stuck song syndrome in the listener –, he has also recently written his autobiography, and taken on a major touring project. In this broadcast, Legrand performs a concert with opera singer Natalie Dessay. Dessay, taking a 'sabbatical' from opera, is probably the most complete and adaptable French singing actress of her generation. These two icons of French music are playing this very special concert at the Orangerie of the Château de Versailles!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258170-Ch-teau-de-versailles-dessay-sings</w></i><x></x></a>
