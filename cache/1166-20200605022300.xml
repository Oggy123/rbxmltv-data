We can hear this in the instrumentation of Keita's music, which varies from traditional West-African instruments to Western European ones. The Malian singer was cast out by his family because of his albinism. In 1967 he moved to Bamako, where he started his musical career and joined Les Ambassadeurs (Internationaux). He achieved international acknowledgement with this band in the 1970s. After spending a couple of years in Ivory Coast, Salif has found his home base in Paris since 1984. During this 2010 concert, he proves to be rightfully referred to as &quot;The Golden Voice of Africa&quot;.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200605/1410023417-Salif-keita-les-ambassadeurs</w></i><x></x></a>
