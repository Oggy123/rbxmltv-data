2016. RY X, Jens Kuross &amp; Eric Price. Musiques En Stock, Cluses, France</k><d>Australian-American singer-songwriter Ry X comes to France's 'Musiques en Stock' festival with the program from his album 'Dawn'. Although Ry composes his music by traditional means – mainly the guitar and the piano – his band members Jens Kuross and Eric Price further decorate his music, adding many electronic music elements. The result is a beautiful, dreamy and airy type of music with a dash of club culture and folkloric elements typical of most contemporary bards and their songs.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258179-Ry-x-festival-music-in-stock-2016</w></i><x></x></a>
