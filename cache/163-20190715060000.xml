They share a long-term committed relationship encompassing their lives and careers and have together raised Armand's son Val. When Val announces his engagement to the daughter of an ultra-conservative U.S. Senator, what choice is there but to accept his decision with love? Meanwhile, Senator Keeley and his wife are watching his right-wing constituency evaporate with the scandalous demise of his closest political ally. A visit to their future in-laws could be just the thing to take the public's focus off the Keeley's messy predicament. With the impending visit of his fiancee's rigid family, Val asks his father to straighten up the apartment just a bit. All is entails is the removal of Armand's art collection, furnishings, clothes, job... and Albert.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20190715/1300592625-The-birdcage</w></i><x></x></a>
