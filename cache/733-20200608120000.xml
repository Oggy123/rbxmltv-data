It’s not for the faint-hearted, but as we learn, neither is the damage these animals can do to each other and farm workers if they’re not de-horned. Then we go Down Under to meet the world’s smallest kangaroo - the endangered woylie - fighting back from the threat of foxes and feral cats that have all but wiped it out. This week’s &quot;How To&quot; has some practical advice on keeping your goldfish as good as gold. These fish are one of the most common pets but few people know how to keep them happy and healthy. And in Animal World, we investigate the remarkable South African Rock Hyrax. Believe it or not, this friendly fellow is a distant cousin of the elephant.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200608/1410106697-Animal-allies-ii-3</w></i><x></x></a>
