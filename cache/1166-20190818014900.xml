2012. Kyoto Jazz Massive, Quasimode &amp; Sleep Walker. Tokyo, Japan</k><d>Jazzed Out proves that a jazz session can take place anywhere. Unusual locations, such as garage buildings, multi-storey car parks, street corners, subway trains, and parks, in several of the world's metropoles, provide the setting for brief jazz performances. The sheer rawness of the metropoles merge with the musical creations of various artists in search of the perfect 'urban stage'.
