On top of favorites from their duo show, like Mozart Bond, Alla Molto Turca, and Cleaning vs. Riverdancing, the show boasts several uproarious sketches, tailor-made for a symphony orchestra, drawing everyone into their act, from the first violinist to the last percussionist. Their 2017 performance at the Grieghallen in Bergen, Norway, is conducted by Andrew Litton.</d></p><i><t>ZÃ¡bava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200417/1390155888-Big-nightmare-music</w></i><x></x></a>
