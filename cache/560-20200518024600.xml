The Gala from Berlin 2004 presents the outstanding Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Sir Simon Rattle, with Carl Orffs well-known 'Carmina Burana' as well as Beethoven's 'Leonore Overture No. 3'. 'Carmina Burana' is intensely dramatic and one of the twentieth century's most widely performed works for chorus and orchestra. Orff himself once said that &quot;Everything which I've written so far and which you've unfortunately published you can now pulp: my collected works begin with Carmina Burana.&quot; Conductor Simon Rattle is a musical force of nature and the interaction between his unique, varied musical gifts and the great performing traditions of the Berlin Philharmonic is one of the most exciting features of our present cultural life.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200518/1400160222-Gala-from-berlin-2004-orff-carmina-burana</w></i><x></x></a>
