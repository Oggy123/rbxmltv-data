Not only was he an indisputable master of organ music, but also a prolific composer whose oeuvre consists of more than 200 works. Buxtehude spent his life traveling between LÃ¼beck and Helsingborg, Hamburg and Copenhagen. Very innovative, at a pivotal time in the history of music, Buxtehude established the 'Abendmusiken' (Evening Concerts) that were introduced by his predecessor Franz Tunder on the five Sundays preceding Christmas. Let's us join the Masques ensemble and the Vox Luminis choir and discover 17th century baroque music and the composer Buxtehude through his vocal compositions, ranging from spiritual concert, choral, aria to cantata parties. The ensembles are led by Olivier Fortin and Lionel Meunier. This concert was recorded in 2017 at Centre Amuz in Antwerp, Belgium.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201104/1460228188-Buxtehude-abendmusik</w></i><x></x></a>
