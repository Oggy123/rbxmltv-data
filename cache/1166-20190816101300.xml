2014. Patrick Watson. Worldwide</k><d>Can jazz play a role in pop and indie music? How do jazz standards inspire today's musicians? This short film is a tribute to Blue Note Records, which celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2014. Colin Solal Cardo visited New York, Montreal, Lisbon, and a small village in Ard√©che, France to find the answers from four seasoned artists. Singer-songwriter Patrick Watson covers &quot;Summertime&quot; with a string quartet, composer Moses Sumney improvises a cappella on &quot;Moanin''' in the streets of New York City, multi-instrumentalist Alex Zhang Hungtai jams on &quot;Blue Train&quot; in a Lisbon cellar, and electronic music producer Mondkopf weaves a propelling piece from &quot;Turning Point&quot; at a campground. Each segment opens with the artists reflecting on a specific musical memory before performing an acoustic set.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190816/1310273260-Take-away-blue-a-blue-note-tribute</w></i><x></x></a>
