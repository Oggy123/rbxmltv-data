Violently opposed to contemporary life, this free, eccentric personality has become a legend within the gypsy world. Agujetas can neither read nor write. He lives in true flamenco style in the suburbs of Jerez in the house he built himself. The film was shot there in the intimacy of his own home, with his Japanese wife who dances for him, in his garden, and at the forge his father left him, where he sings as he hammers at the anvil. He also sings at a 'venta', a concert in a neighbouring village, accompanied by Moraito on the guitar. Agujetas' friends - his real fans - help us to understand his art: they tell us about his beginnings, his very unusual personality and about his famous Flamenco father from whom he learnt everything and to whose art he has remained faithful.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200418/1390175373-Agujetas-cantaor</w></i><x></x></a>
