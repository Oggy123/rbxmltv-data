It's not easiest task in the world for her she explains to Victor for while Pat is the loveliest animal on earth she doesn't see him as much of an adventurer. While Lola is sharing her reservations Pat sets out to save Hoodies skin again and again sees off the Guanos. Not an adventurer? Me? After saving the kitten he discovers a nest with a baby bird inside teetering dangerously in the branches of a tree. Pat fetches Lola and the pair saves the bird. At last Lola has the subject she's been looking for. Being a hero doesn't always mean leaping without looking or whitewater rafting. Sometimes the little things we do day-to-day can be heroic. Which makes Pat a superhero.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/boomerang/20200419/1390020555-Pat-the-dog</w></i><x></x></a>
