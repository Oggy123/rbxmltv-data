Sinatra belts out For Once In My Lifeand it is perfection. Being the last of his five specials, his wit and banter is as engaging as ever. He narrates us through his movie clips with the timing of a stand-up comedian. The up tempo closing of the show makes it complete with My Kind Of Town.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200423/1390461058-Sinatra-featuring-don-costa-and-his-orchestra</w></i><x></x></a>
