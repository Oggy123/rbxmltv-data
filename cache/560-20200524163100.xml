With a 20, 000-seat capacity, these events are some of the most popular classical music concerts in the world. In 2003, Seiji Ozawa and the Berliner Philharmoniker perform works by George Gershwin with the jazz pianist Marcus Roberts and his Trio as special guests. Their album &quot;Gershwin For Lovers&quot; stayed in the Top 10 on Billboard's jazz chart for half a year. Together they created a magical fusion of classical music and jazz bringing an imaginative mix of styles into the swing of Gershwin's music.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200524/1400282790-Waldb-hne-2003-a-gershwin-night</w></i><x></x></a>
