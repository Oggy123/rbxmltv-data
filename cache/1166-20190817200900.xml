2006. Al Jarreau. LRS Media Studios, Chicago, Unites States</k><d>With the exception of DJAZZ.tv, there is hardly any jazz on television. Jazz pianist and broadcaster Ramsey Lewis has addressed this vacuum with his programme series 'Legends of Jazz'. This interesting series brings together musicians who are not usually paired. This episode features two great male jazz vocalists: Al Jarreau and Kurt Elling. Jarreau is the only vocalist in the history of the Grammy Awards to win awards in three different categories (Jazz, Pop and R&amp;B). He's been compared to legends such as Billy Eckstine and Johnny Mathis, and he has been thrilling audiences since his 1975 debut, the top-selling 'We Got By'. Multiple Grammy-nominee Kurt Elling is one of the great modern proponents of the 'vocalese' tradition of marrying original lyrics to classic jazz solos. Jarreau and Elling perform and talk with Ramsey Lewis about the great male vocalists, as well as their own lives and times on stage and in the studio. Although these two master vocalists approach jazz from opposite directions, Al Jarreau and Kurt Elling came up with a duet on 'Take Five' that will become a classic.
