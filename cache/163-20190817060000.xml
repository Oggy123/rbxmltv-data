Initially finding his new tresses delightfully intriguing, Stockwell soon discovers that the new coloring singles him out for ridicule and rejection in his small town. Although the sympathetic O'Brien tries to create understanding in the community, the townspeople call for a shaving of the boy's head. Feeling unloved and unwanted, Stockwell runs away. Pausing to sleep during his escape, Stockwell dreams of meeting other war orphans who urge him to return to the town to preach the stupidity of war and to make his neighbors aware of the horrible realities of how simple misunderstandings and the inability to accept what is different can lead to armed conflict. Well-intentioned but pretentious drama that, despite some distinct humane touches from O'Brien, fails to create any sympathy because of its overblown profundity. An early work in the career of cult director Losey, the film points out its creator's penchant for laying it on thick. Notable is the song &quot;Nature Boy,&quot; which appears for the first time in this film; it was written by eden ahbez who refused to employ capital letters, insisting that they be exclusively used for the word &quot;God.&quot;</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20190817/1310241712-The-boy-with-green-hair</w></i><x></x></a>
