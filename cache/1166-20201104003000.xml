One of the orchestra's ambitions is to cooperate with other art disciplines, and to contribute to the local cultural climate in the East of the Netherland. Recently, JazzArt has agreed with Odeon Theatres in Zwolle, the Netherlands, to play two concerts a year at the Odeon Theatre. In these concerts, the orchestra collaborates with the winners of the Dutch Jazz Vocal Competition. This broadcast presents a concert registration of a 2015 concert from the Odeon Theatre in Zwolle. Performers are vocalists Ruben Hein, the gents of CC Campbell, Fay Klaassen, trumpeter Eric Vloeimans and keyboardist Folkert Oosterbeek.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20201104/1460050273-10th-anniversary-jazzart-orchestra-friends</w></i><x></x></a>
