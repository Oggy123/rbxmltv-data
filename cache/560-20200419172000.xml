With virtuosic flair and an eagerness to expand the repertoire, a new generation of pianists has revitalized the instrument's appeal. In addition to the usual classics, they perform formerly scorned works or discover neglected composers. Legato is a series dedicated to presenting some of this new movement's most fascinating pianists – their individual approaches, their fresh ideas and their music. Each episode portrays an artist and shows an aspect of the world of the piano. The sum of these portraits provides viewers with an overall picture of the art of the pianist. Montréal native Marc-André Hamelin is internationally renowned for his musical virtuosity and refined pianism. The Times described one of his performances as &quot;ultimate perfection&quot;. He plays works by Haydn (Piano sonata in E major), Chopin (Piano sonata No. 3), Debussy ('Préludes', book two), Hamelin (Etude No. 7), as well as two short pieces by Gershwin ('Do, Do, Do' and 'Liza').</d></p><i><t>Seriál</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200419/1390176945-Legato-world-of-the-piano</w></i><x></x></a>
