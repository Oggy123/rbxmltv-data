In her projects, Elias wears many hats: she serves as producer, composer, lyricist, arranger, pianist, and vocalist. In this concert broadcast, recorded live at the Philharmonie in Munich, Elias shows her distinctive and immediately recognizable musical style, which blends her Brazilian samba roots and her sensuous, alluring voice with her impressive instrumental bebop, jazz, classical, and compositional skills. She is an artist beyond category, and in this concert she performs with Jay Randall Anderson (bass) and Adam Nussbaum (drums).</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200418/1390175395-M-nchner-klaviersommer-eliane-elias-trio</w></i><x></x></a>
