Kožená's musical range seems expandable to infinity: whether adopting Cole Porter or Duparc, Mahler or Martinu, her mezzo-soprano voice works wonders. However, within the richness of her career, baroque music remains a favourite repertoire, as proven once more by this recital in the Church of Verbier filmed in the summer of 2018. It demonstrates a remarkable simplicity: alternation of vocal and short sparkling instrumental works. The programme illustrates &quot;blindness in love&quot;, a theme which is best embodied by the magnificent Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda. Magdalena Kožená here changes the Church into a theater hall: on a sleekly decorated stage, with a moving naivety, the singer seizes a few accessories to improvise the narrative and the medieval legend is revived by her hallucinated expression. An extremely beautiful moment.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200418/1390165432-Andrea-marcon-conducts-la-cetra-barockorchester</w></i><x></x></a>
