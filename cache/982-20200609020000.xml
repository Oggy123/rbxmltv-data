Režie: Titus Muntean.</k><d>In an isolated village in Transylvania, at the beginning of the 60s, the people live relative peaceful lives under the leadership of TANASIE, the local Peoples Councils President. A mobile cinema, run by a young and ambitious communist activist, TAVI, arrives with the express mission of making a propaganda film projection. Its Tavi s first assignment and he struggles to make a success of it. Except that the endless rain causes flooding, and the inertia of some of the villagers continually frustrates his plans. Each of them is somehow unwilling to participate or to support the projection, but they are cannily not showing an open opposition. Tavi is very ambitious and has the power of the party behind him. His pressure produces fear, and Tanasie is being held responsible. Slowly, under Tanasies prodding, everybody has to make some compromises so as to survive the whole event.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/filmbox-arthouse/20200609/1410148223-Kino-caravan</w></i><x></x></a>
