Main soloists are Jose Maria Lo Monaco (Carmen), Yonghoon Lee (Don José), Giorgio Caoduro (Escamillo) Elena Galitskaya (Frasquita) and Nathalie Manfrino (Micaëla). The opera, written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue, tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naive soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. Georges Bizet's 19th century masterpiece of French opera has constantly been a worldwide success since its laborious creation at the Opera Comique in Paris; to such an extent, in fact, that today it is the most popular opera in the world. This production is directed by Olivier Py and recorded at the Opéra de Lyon in 2012.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200517/1400148643-Carmen-bizet</w></i><x></x></a>
