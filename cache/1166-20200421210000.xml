They started out as a local band in a small French industrial town, but today they play for raving crowds like the one at 'Rock in Rio', where over 100.000 fans showed their appreciation. For over a quarter of a century, the Tambours du Bronx make creative use of used oil barrels to play an unusual type of music. Tambours du Bronx has not gone unnoticed with legendary acts like Sepultura, Mathieu Kassovitz, and Didier Wampas. The documentary combines footage from various concerts, rehearsals, and interviews to show the artistic revolution the band goes through.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200421/1390257395-A-barrel-of-laughs</w></i><x></x></a>
