The two are as compatible as escargot and sauerkraut. It's 1938 and Grant is an American radio broadcaster (like Ed Murrow) in Europe reporting on the approaching war. Rogers is a Brooklyn girl who'd spent some time peeling off her clothes for bald men, but she's now posing as a society woman and has married Slezak, a big man in the Nazi scheme of things. She thinks he's just a rich Austrian nobleman. His job is to help the Hitler gang get into the other countries. When she finds out the truth, Grant and Rogers get closer, so she leaves with him during a bombing in Poland. They race across Scandinavia and wind up in France where they join forces with Dekker, an American spy, to help fight the Germans. Grant and Rogers leave for the US, and Slezak drowns as he's on his way to spy in the States. The few comedy scenes are funny, but there is a lot of talk and no action in most of the other sequences. It's far too realistic to be comedic. They spent some money making the picture, and the use of newsreel clips was excellent. Taken section by section, the parts add up to somewhat more than the whole. The film earned an Oscar nomination for Best Sound.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20190716/1300592634-Once-upon-a-honeymoon</w></i><x></x></a>
