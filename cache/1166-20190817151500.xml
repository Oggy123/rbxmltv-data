2015. Typhoon. BIRD, Rotterdam, The Netherlands</k><d>Rotterdam's ' BIRD' is a club, caf√© and restaurant with a live music programme that's deeply rooted in jazz, and also branches out towards soul, funk, hip-hop and electronic music as well. Its name 'BIRD' refers to the nickname of the legendary New York jazz saxophonist, bebop co-founder Charlie Parker (1920-1955). BIRD serves Neapolitan pizzas, good wines, no-nonsense beers and an all-round metropolitan rawness. Since 2014, this urban jazz club and DJAZZ.tv have been collaborating for a series of music programmes: 'BIRD.tv', allowing you to experience the best BIRD concerts and interviews as from the first row! This episode is a fantastic capture of the after party of the North Sea Jazz Festival: Boogieball. This mega jam session is a great coming together of, amongst others, bassist Marcus Miller, Chris Dave, and Typhoon.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190817/1310284475-Birdtv-boogieball-with-marcus-miller</w></i><x></x></a>
