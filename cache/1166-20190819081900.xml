1961. Count Basie, Snooky Young, Frank Wess &amp; Joe Williams. Palais des Beaux-Arts, Charleroi, Belgium</k><d>Count Basie is one of the most important bandleaders of the swing era. With the exception of a brief period in the early '50s, he led a big band from 1935 until his death almost 50 years later. Basie's orchestra was characterized by a light, swinging rhythm section that he led from the piano, lively ensemble work, and generous soloing. Basie was not a composer like Duke Ellington or an important soloist like Benny Goodman. His instrument was his band, which was considered the epitome of swing and deeply influenced jazz. In this 1961 concert recording, Count Basie takes the stage in Charleroi.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190819/1310312866-Count-basie-and-his-orchestra-live-in</w></i><x></x></a>
