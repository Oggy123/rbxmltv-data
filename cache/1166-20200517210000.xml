While the festival's program is always eclectic and diverse, the aim remains the same: to highlight the most innovative jazz artists of both the future and the past. The festival celebrates jazz history, often paying tribute to a particularly important year or an inspiring musician, while at the same time bringing the modern jazz of today. In 2014, the Shai Maestro Trio performed here, consisting of pianist Shai Maestro, bassist Jorge Roeder, and drummer Ziv Ravitz. With his personal signature sound, the trio's leader expresses an incredible musical fluidity, qualifying this trio as one of the most powerful and harmonious bands in today's jazz.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200517/1400158542-Shai-maestro-trio-jazz-a-la-villette</w></i><x></x></a>
