When he suddenly has a premonition that their airplane will crash, he screams out in panic to warn the others, but instead he is thrown off of the plane. Alex is luckily one of seven students who skip the flight -- getting off the aircraft moments before an explosion rips through the cabin, decimating the plane in midair. However, the seven students soon find out that the Grim Reaper doesn't like to be cheated when the surviving students start dying mysteriously--one by one.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20190818/1310241734-Final-destination</w></i><x></x></a>
