<a><n>Mahler - Symphony No. 9</n><s o="2020-11-06 03:33:00" d="2020-11-06 04:58:00" n="Brava HDTV" id_tv="560"></s><p><k>Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra, Claudio Abbado</k><d>Due to the occasionally grim atmosphere of this composition by Gustav Mahler, and his use of Ludwig van Beethoven's Sonata 'Les Adieux', it has been suggested that his 'Ninth Symphony' was composed as a musical farewell. The dramatic words the composer wrote next to the score's final bars added to that: 'Farewell! Cruel world! Dearest Almschi! Farewell! Farewell!'. As Mahler immediately started composing his 'Symphony No. 10', you wonder if this symphony was really meant to be a farewell, but it still is his last completed symphony. Mahler started the composition in 1909 when he worked in New York for the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. Although he had finished a successful season, his health was weak: as early as 1907 Mahler had been diagnosed with a serious cardiac anomaly. In 1911 Mahler died, aged 50. He has never heard his No. 9 performed live, as it premiered in Vienna in 1912, performed by the Wiener Philharmoniker under direction of Bruno Walter. Musicologists entertain the thought that the self-critical Mahler would certainly have made the necessary adjustments, had he been able to conduct the work himself. In this sense, not only his 'No. 10', but his 'No. 9' too, remains incomplete.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201106/1460228226-Mahler-symphony-no-9</w></i><x></x></a>
