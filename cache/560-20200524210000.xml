At the end of his life, Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi considered Rigoletto as his most beautiful and accomplished opera. Inspired by Victor Hugo's play &quot;Le roi s'amuse&quot;, created for the French Theater in 1832, Verdi is particularly intrigued with the buffoon's tragic character. Despite the strong pressure of the moral and religious censorship of the time, Rigoletto - after its premiere on March 11th, 1851 in Venice – was received with great enthusiasm. The next day, all of Venice hummed the melody of 'La donna e mobile'! The plot of the opera revolves around the struggles of Rigoletto, Duke of Mantua's buffoon and depraved seducer and his daughter, Gilda. This interpretation was recorded 2015 at the Opéra Royal de Wallonie, Liege and stars Leo Nucci, Desirée Rancatore, Gianluca Terranova, Luciano Montanaro, Carla Dirlikov, Benoit Delvaux and more.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200524/1400282795-Verdi-rigoletto</w></i><x></x></a>
