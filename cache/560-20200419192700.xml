Like many early symphonies from the composer, Symphony No. 29 is scored for 2 oboes, 2 horns and strings. The piece, consisting of four movements, was completed by Mozart in 1774 and is one of the better-known early compositions. British musicologist Stanley Sadie called it a piece 'of an intimate, chamber music style with a still-fiery and impulsive manner'. Italian pianist and conductor Claudio Abbado, born 1933 in Milan, was known for being a man of few words and many grand gestures. He worked with the Berlin Philharmonic over the span of over 35 years and acted as the orchestra's chief conductor and artistic director from 1989 on. This recording of Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic shows a concert from 1991, recorded at the Smetana Hall in Prague, Czech Republic.</d></p><i><t>ZÃ¡bava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200419/1390176947-Mozart-symphony-in-a-major-k-201</w></i><x></x></a>
