Don't mistake this Spanish powerhouse for a carbon copy of either, however, as Patáx presents an accomplished mix of styles, including soul, jazz, funk and hip-hop. The group is led by the passionate Spanish-American percussionist Jorge Perez, who draws his musical influence from both sides of the Atlantic. The tight interplay between Perez and his bandmates as well as the audience's enthusiasm at Teatro Calderón in Madrid make it a night to remember.
