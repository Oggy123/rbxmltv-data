He was full of fresh admiration for Brahms' third symphony and he had just been planning to start on a new composition himself. The first ideas presented themselves when he entered the train station in Prague and a train full of men from Pest drew in. The group was in Prague for a special programme at the National Theatre that was aimed at increasing awareness of the political struggles of the Czech nation. Dvorák decided that his symphony had to reflect these struggles, leading to the birth of a masterpiece. In this broadcast: the third movement.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200419/1390176949-Dvorak-symphony-no-7-op-70-iii-scherzo</w></i><x></x></a>
