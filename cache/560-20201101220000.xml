This opera projects the restless romantic anti-hero archetype through a bored Russian aristocrat caught between convention and listlessness. Tchaikovsky's beloved lyrical ability is on full display in this opera, which transforms western European operatic idioms into a truly Russian work of art. The composer takes a neatly episodic approach to examining all manner of societal walks of life, from the pastoral to rural gentry and aristocratic. This performance includes Peter Mattei (baritone), Larissa Diadkova (mezzo soprano), Elena Maximova (mezzo soprano) and Anna Netrebko (soprano).
