It will also share the adventure of men and women who are both anchored in tradition and turned towards the future, and who discover the pleasure of telling their story, acting and inventing with means that, until now, have only ever offered a superficial image of themselves.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20190816/1310163583-The-himbas-are-shooting</w></i><x></x></a>
