The Berliner Philharmoniker, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle along with some of the most sought-after singers in this field including Thomas Hampson, Kim Criswell, Simone Sauphanor and Karl Daymond perform Leonard Bernstein's 'Wonderful Town'. 'Wonderful Town' was the second of Bernstein's trio of 'New York' musicals begun in 1944 with 'On The Town' and completed with 1957's 'West Side Story' and is a love letter to New York in the '30's. Bernstein's score combines witty pastiches of various popular musical styles of the 30s - Conga!, Swing! - and some of his most winning ballads. The program also includes George Gershwin's songs 'My Man's Gone Now', 'Ask Me Again' and 'Fascinatin' Rhythm'.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200418/1390165459-Gala-from-berlin-2002-what-a-wonderful-town</w></i><x></x></a>
