2014. Gregory Porter, Chip Crawford, Aaron James &amp; Emanuel Harrold. L'Olympia Bruno Coquatrix, Paris, France</k><d>Unlike many of his fellow jazz cats, vocalist Gregory Porter transcends the jazz bubble. After sustaining a shoulder injury, this former American football player turned to jazz singing. He was discovered in a Californian jazz club by pianist, saxophonist and composer Kamau Kenyatta. Porter lent his vocal skills to gospel choirs across the country and a string of successful musicals before turning his talent to his own compositions. His rise since then has been meteoric. Porter's magnificent, burnished baritone can sink into a lyric with luxurious ease, the melody gently sculpted into new shapes at every turn, with the rhythm tugging subtly back and forth across the bar line. This live performance at the Olympia showcases this man's worth, and is a truly amazing experience!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190818/1310298203-Gregory-porter-at-the-blue-note-festival</w></i><x></x></a>
