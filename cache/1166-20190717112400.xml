2012. Sven Hammond Soul. Tivoli, Utrecht, Holland</k><d>Although its music might sound like the sound track of any 1970s American car chase movie, the band Sven Hammond Soul is from the Netherlands. This steaming soul machine is headed by Sven Figee, who prefers to attack rather than play his Hammond organ. In April 2012, the band was augmented with vocalist Jenny Lane. Today's recordings were made at a steaming live performance at Utrecht's Tivoli in 2012.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190717/1300253331-Sven-hammond-soul-tivoli-de-helling</w></i><x></x></a>
