Animal Doctor Tanya Schoeman advises a nervous owner that Ridgeback, Misango needs chemotherapy. We’ll follow Misango’s brave fight from treatment to triumph. Our Animal Helper this week sounds like a character straight out of James Bond. He’s training bees to join the fight against the shadowy world of international terrorism. And their uncanny abilities are creating quite a buzz. Bigger definitely isn’t better when it comes to over-pampered pets. In our Animal Allies “How To”, we’ll tell you all you need to know about managing your moggy’s weight. And in Animal World you’ll meet the fearsome saltwater crocodile that’s causing more than a few anxious moments for residents of Western Australia’s rugged far north. Moving the seven metre menace out of harm’s way takes courage and planning.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200520/1400313764-Animal-allies-ii-10</w></i><x></x></a>
