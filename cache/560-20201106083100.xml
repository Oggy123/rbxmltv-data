However, he is best known as a harpsichordist and teacher. His fellow Neapolitan Enrico Baiano pays homage to Paradisi with a selection from his volume of scintillating solo sonatas for harpsichord, which became popular throughout Europe.</k><d>Internationally renowned and award-winning keyboard virtuoso Enrico Baiano performs a selection of works by the Italian composer Pietro Domenico Paradisi as part of the 2019 Utrecht Early Music Festival. Paradisi's work is stylistically similar to that of Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti, from whom the composer took much influence. Though there has been a significant effort to revive a broad selection of Paradisi's music, he is most prominently known for his highly regarded harpsichord works, the most famous, which is his &quot;Sonata No. 6&quot;, which commences this program. This performance was recorded at the Lutherse Kerk in Utrecht, The Netherlands.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201106/1460228230-Naples-city-of-keyboards-pier-domenico-paradisi</w></i><x></x></a>
