Ray Allen scored a career playoff-high 51 points for the Celtics, but it's back to Boston for Game 7 after another instant classic in a series that had already seen its share of drama. Three of the first five games went to overtime, including a Game 4 that went two extra periods. Another came down to the wire in regulation, but this easily trumped them all.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/nba-sd/20190822/1310892560-Celtics-bulls-2009-eastern-conference-1st-round-game-6</w></i><x></x></a>
