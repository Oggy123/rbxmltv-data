Hrají: Anne Marie Chertic, Constantin Chiriac, Paul Chiributa. Režie: Silviu Purcarete.</k><d>Somewhere in Palilula is placed in the 60s in Romania and tells the story of Serafim, a fresh graduate of medical school, brought by a gloomy whim of destiny to the town of Palilula. Nowhere, that is. Palilula is a ghost town, lost in the middle of the Vallahian plain. A quarantine area, a sanatorium, improbable hospital, a gynecological clinic in a settlement where no child is born. A community of Romanians who forgot their language, but not the nostalgia of their traditional music. Romanians with Danubian taste and disorientation. The young doctor Serafim will not get to practice his profession as a pediatrician, in this childless town. He will be drowning in the sweet and poisoned honey of the place, like a fly caught by a frog.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/filmbox-arthouse/20190820/1310109690-Somewhere-in-palilula</w></i><x></x></a>
