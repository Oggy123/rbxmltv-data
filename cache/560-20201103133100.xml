It portrays extraordinary composers who were active in the cultural city of Vienna and deserve the label of genius. In A Lion's Roar (Part 2) we follow the life and work of Ludwig van Beethoven. More has been written about Beethoven than any other composer, yet he remains a man of mystery. In early adulthood he moved from Bonn to Vienna to study with Haydn. Within a year he had established himself as Vienna's finest piano virtuoso. He admired Haydn and Mozart and learned much from them, yet his music was so unlike what came before. With Ludwig we always feel like a storm is just around the corner. His emotions would quickly erupt, like when he tried to break a chair over the head of his patron Prince Lichnowsky. It was Beethoven who built the creative bridge from the Classical Period to the Romantic Period, all while living in Vienna.</d></p><i><t>Seri√°l</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201103/1460228173-Sons-of-vienna-part-2-a-lion-s-roar</w></i><x></x></a>
