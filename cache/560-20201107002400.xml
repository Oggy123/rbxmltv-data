This performance is taken from Daniel Barenboim's highly esteemed complete rendition of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas, recorded at the Palais Rasumofsky, Vienna, Austria, in 1983.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201107/1460228243-Beethoven-piano-sonata-no-13-op-27-no-1</w></i><x></x></a>
