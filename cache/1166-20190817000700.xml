2016. China Moses, Joe Armon Jones &amp; Luke Wynter. Jazz a Ramatuelle, France</k><d>In 1988, Dee Dee Bridgewater was one of the first great jazz singers to perform at the Jazz Festival in Ramatuelle. In 2016, the story seems to repeat itself as her daughter China Moses took the stage at Ramatuelle. Over the years, China Moses has become a mature performer with a unique style: rocky voice, sharp sense of swing, and intense/energetic stage presence. After signing compilations dedicated to Dinah Washington and blues, Moses released in 2016 an album of his own compositions, entitled &quot;Whatever&quot;. Get ready for a most entertaining performance combining jazz, soul, and hip-hop.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190817/1310284460-China-moses-whatever-at-jazz-a</w></i><x></x></a>
