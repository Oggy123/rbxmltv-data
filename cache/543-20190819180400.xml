Coldplay, which is not any band, decided to turn the show into a historic night for those who went to Glastonbury. It all started with the fact that the show consecrated Coldplay as the first band playing FOUR times on the 'Pyramid Stage' (main stage of the festival)! With the performance ending a few hours ago, Coldplay completed six shows in the history of the big music event. Speaking of incredible numbers, the band made Xylobands available to over 100,000 people at Glastonbury!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190819/1310109158-Coldplay-live-at-glastonbury</w></i><x></x></a>
