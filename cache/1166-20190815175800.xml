2005. Terry Callier. Quasimodo, Berlin, Germany</k><d>Three generations of listeners have been turned on to the music of mystic singer/ songwriter Terry Callier. During the 1960s, concerts in New York, made him a leading figure in the early folk boom. In the 1970s, recordings crystallised his style- a unique brand of soul, folk, jazz and a deeply moving poetry. It gained him an impassioned following among R&amp;B hipsters and reinforced his reputation as a vocal legend. Following a series of disillusioning experiences amid the disco-craze in the early 1980s, Callier took his leave from the music business. For 15 years, Terry Callier led his life unnoticed. In the mid 1990s, the blossoming Clubs in Britain are looking for outstanding musical inspirations. London based DJ Gilles Peterson happens to find a single that blows his mind and that is soon to reach cult status in the clubs. The man who has written music history in the 1960s and 1970s, returns to the stage after a 15 year break, literally talked into a comeback by an audience that had kept on asking for his music. &quot;Terry Callier - Live in Concert&quot; covers the unique work of this legendary singer/songwriter.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258180-Terry-callier-live-in-berlin</w></i><x></x></a>
