What you'll witness here, then, is an inspiring and altogether good-natured example of survival embodied by original Wishbone guitarist Andy Powell. Looking youthful at 50, his formerly long hair now shaved off altogether, Powell remains a virtuoso ax-man, matched by fellow ace Mark Birch (temporarily filling the shoes of the departed Ted Turner) to recreate Wishbone's signature twin-guitar sound. As the sole survivor of Wishbone's original lineup, Powell happily presides over the group's considerable legacy, epitomized here by outstanding performances of the Ash classics &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Blowin' Free.&quot; The concert's a no-frills affair with an occasionally uneven mix, but the music comes through with clarity and gusto, reminding us that Wishbone Ash's unique blend of musicianship remains influential some three decades later.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200419/1390317027-Live-30th-anniversary-concert</w></i><x></x></a>
