It was filmed and recorded at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. The filmed concert was aired on PBS as an episode of Great Performances, and the show was subsequently released on DVD along with the audio CD to create the album package, although the audio disc only featured eight of the songs from the concert. The concert featured a few guest artists, including Laura Pausini, Chris Botti, and with an unexpected comedic banter with Bublé, Josh Groban.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190818/1310109134-Michael-buble-caught-in-the-act</w></i><x></x></a>
