From the beautiful Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, Robert Plant and the Sensational Space Shifters join forces with David Lynch to put on a once in a lifetime show at his inaugural Festival of Disruption to help benefit the David Lynch Foundation. Plant performs his solo hits and also tackles Led Zeppelin’s classics with a bit of a Sensational Space Shifters twist. The Sensational Space Shifters is comprised of some of the finest musicians around with Plant, Justin Adams, Juldeh Camara, Billy Fuller, Liam “Skin” Tyson and Dave Smith. For those who never had the opportunity to see Led Zeppelin, this band brings the well-known hits to life but adds a global twist complete with exotic beats and Plant taking on hand drums. Favorites included “Over The Hills,” “Black Dog,” “Rock N Roll,” “Whole Lotta Love” and “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You.”</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200418/1390295988-Robert-plant-live-at-festival-of-disruption</w></i><x></x></a>
