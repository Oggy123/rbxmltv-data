Henry Walters, a teacher and medicine man illustrates this difference, sharing his knowledge and passion as he relates his peoples’ traditions. From the origin of all things, to plants used in ceremonies and healings, Henry’s calm nature draws us deep into his narrative, like a dreamtime of wisdom. Share in this experience and gain greatly from Henry’s deep understanding of the Navajo tradition.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20190817/1310163596-Guides-gurus-arizona</w></i><x></x></a>
