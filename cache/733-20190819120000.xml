The little-known rebel prince was an art collector and played a key role in the family. From the banishment of the Bonapartes from Corsica to the coup of 18 Brumaire... one man was present through every step of Napoleon’s destiny: his brother Lucien. Without him, the course of history might well have taken a different turn. Discover the many facets of this complex personality: politician, Minister of Internal Affairs, art collector, poet and novelist, member of the Académie française, Laetizia’s darling son... Lucien Bonaparte was, above all, the only brother to have stood up to the French Emperor.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20190819/1310163665-Lucien-bonaparte-the-rebellious-brother</w></i><x></x></a>
