The introduction of the first movement's second theme is delayed by means of a fragment in the relative minor. The D minor slow movement is especially expressive, building dramatic tension only relieved by the succeeding Minuet. The final Rondo begins hesitantly before finding solid ground. This performance is taken from Daniel Barenboim's highly esteemed complete rendition of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas, recorded at the Palais Rasumofsky, Vienna, Austria, in 1983.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201030/1450506272-Beethoven-piano-sonata-no-7-op-10-no-3</w></i><x></x></a>
