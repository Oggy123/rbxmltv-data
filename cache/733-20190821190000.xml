It is now estimated that one in every eight women in the UK will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 12,000 will die. This documentary investigates the world of routine breast screening (mammography) from its conception in 1987 to the modern day. We examine the benefits and risks associated with mammography and ask why the NHS has dismissed other available methods of medically recognised screening tests.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20190821/1310163735-Promise</w></i><x></x></a>
