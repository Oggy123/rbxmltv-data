Greatly appreciated for their memorable performances in Coutances, the quartet of Erik Truffaz is back with a new album called Doni Doni . Always composed of the bassist Marcello Giuliani, Benoit Corboz on the keyboards, the group draws new energy since the arrival of Arthur Hnatek , a young drummer from New York who officiates with Tigran Hamasyan . Their music , enriched with world influences , oscillates slightly between jazz and instrumental pop . Their stage performance style is marked by their great musical complicity and a widely shared with their audience pleasure.

Recorded on May 5th 2016 at the Macel Helie Hall, Coutances
