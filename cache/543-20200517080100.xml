<a><n>Bonnie Raitt: Montreux 1977</n><s o="2020-05-17 08:01:00" d="2020-05-17 08:58:00" n="iConcerts" id_tv="543"></s><p><d>Appearing at the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival in 1977, Bonnie Raitt had been supporting her release 'Sweet Forgiveness', which featured her first charting single, a cover of Del Shannon’s “Runaway”, which would peak at the 57th position on the Billboard Pop charts. Although it would still be 12 years before she became a national star, this 1977 show proves she was no stranger to the Blues community, pulling selections from her 6 albums at that point. This performance offers a rare glimpse at Bonnie Raitt years before she became the darling of the music industry. Also included is a taste of her 1991 performance at the Festival, which features a performance of “Three Time Loser”, along with “Good Man, Good Woman” and “Papa Come Quick” from her 1991 effort 'Luck of the Draw'.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200517/1400262966-Bonnie-raitt-montreux-1977</w></i><x></x></a>
