Together with his stellar band of pianist Dave Frishberg, guitarist John Pisano, bassist Dave Stone, and drummer Frank Capp, Sheldon works his way through a magically swinging &quot;Don't get around much anymore&quot; followed by a heartfelt rendition of a Spanish arrangement of &quot;Historia De Un Amor&quot;. After several standards, a lovely interpretation of Jobim's &quot;Corcovado&quot; paves the way for a high-energy set closer, &quot;The Joint is Jumpin'&quot;, which is illustrative of the irrepressible swing that this jazz icon's concerts have been bringing to his audiences ever since he first picked up his trumpet in the early 1950s.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200524/1400293511-New-orleans-jack-sheldon-and-his-all-stars</w></i><x></x></a>
