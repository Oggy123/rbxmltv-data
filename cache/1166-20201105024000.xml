It earned them gushing reviews, three Grammy nominations and high-profile fans like Robert Plant and Jack White. Watching them on stage, it's easy to see why. At their sold out Sydney gig, the Shakes were powerful, playful and gut-wrenchingly good. At the centre of it all lies Howard, a howling storm of soul and swagger, who proved as charming as she is cheeky.
