Hosted annually in Bremen, Germany, it brings together musicians, bookers, agents, organizers, jazz experts, and music enthusiasts. In 2019, jazzahead! pays special attention to Norway by selecting 40 jazz acts from all over the world and inviting them to perform over the course of three days. Among them is trombonist Janning Trumann's sextet, with pianist Lucas Leidinger, trumpeter Verneri Pohjola, vibraphonist Dierk Peters, drummer Thomas Sauerborn, and bassist Florian Herzog. Collectively, they display a creative energy that is fed by intensive interaction, proving once again that an ensemble is more than the sum of its parts.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200420/1390239002-Janning-trumann-6-jazzahead</w></i><x></x></a>
