She started singing fado when she was 16. Her debut album is called 'Alma Nova' and marked the beginning of her amazing career. For the recordings of her next two albums, 'Luz Destino' and 'Senhora da Lapa' Maria Ana welcomed instruments that are usually not present in fado music: the harpsichord and saxophone. After that, she continued her career with the release of 'Nome de Mar', which received many positive reviews. At the moment, Maria Ana is performing at all Portugal's major venues, as well as many festivals and concert halls throughout the world, with the aim to present fado music and Portuguese culture to other cultures. Bobone's latest album, 'Fado &amp; Piano', shows her diversity as an artist, composer and arranger. By including the piano she re-innovates the tradition of the early 20th century. This portrait shows Maria Ana's performances and interviews in which she explains her passion for fado music and culture.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200520/1400201046-Portrait-of-maria-ana-bobone</w></i><x></x></a>
