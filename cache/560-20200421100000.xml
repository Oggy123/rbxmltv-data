Recorded at Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome 2004, the film vividly shows the joy, talent, and professionalism of the young musicians drawn from all over Europe and their devotion to Claudio Abbado. A wonderful homage to orchestra, conductor, composer and to a triumphant master work - Gustav Mahler's magnificent 9th symphony.</d></p><i><t>ZÃ¡bava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200421/1390247446-Mahler-symphony-no-9</w></i><x></x></a>
