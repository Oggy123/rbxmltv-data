Under the theme &quot;The Year 1882&quot;, the acclaimed orchestra is lead by conductor Sir Simon Rattle as it interprets Brahms' &quot;Concerto for violin, cello and orchestra&quot;, his Fourth Symphony and Wagners' &quot;Prelude to Act I&quot; from Parsifal - the piece that marked the orchestra's first recorded work of September 1913 under the baton of Alfred Hertz. The soloists are Lisa Batiashvili (violin) and Truls M?rk (cello), established as sought-after young virtuosos and appearing regularly with leading orchestras and in recitals throughout the world. The &quot;Kraftwerk und Kabelwerk Oberspree (power and cable factory)&quot;, the remarkable venue of this concert, is one of the most impressive historical industrial building from the late 19th century in Berlin. As its impressive presence is infused with Brahms and Wagner, there is an air of total commitment, only enhanced further by the unusual surroundings. The collaboration of Lisa Batiashvili and Truls M?rk ensures a moving performance of Brahms's last orchestral work, his Double Concerto. Following this, Rattle and the orchestra continue to demonstrate their outstanding musicianship, delivering Wagner's amazingly fresh and dynamic Fourth Symphony.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200607/1410027871-Europakonzert-2007-berlin</w></i><x></x></a>
