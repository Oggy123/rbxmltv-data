The winner will get to present a TV show with him. Lola is naturally taking part in the contest as she loves to cook. Victor, who loves showing off, is also taking part. And he has plans to win the contest – by switching his pie for Lola’s pie. Pat is keeping close watch however, especially since the delicious aroma emanating from Lola’s cake has attracted the greedy Guanos' attention.
