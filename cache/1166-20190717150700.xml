1984. Jack Sheldon. New Orleans, U.S.A.</k><d>At this live 1984 performance at Lulu White's Mahogany Hall in New Orleans, veteran jazz trumpeter, singer, and actor Jack Sheldon and his all-star ensemble perform a program of straight-ahead jazz pieces that finds them sizzling no end. Together with his stellar band of pianist Dave Frishberg, guitarist John Pisano, bassist Dave Stone, and drummer Frank Capp, Sheldon works his way through a magically swinging &quot;Don't get around much anymore&quot; followed by a heartfelt rendition of a Spanish arrangement of &quot;Historia De Un Amor&quot;. After several standards, a lovely interpretation of Jobim's &quot;Corcovado&quot; paves the way for a high-energy set closer, &quot;The Joint is Jumpin'&quot;, which is illustrative of the irrepressible swing that this jazz icon's concerts have been bringing to his audiences ever since he first picked up his trumpet in the early 1950s.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190717/1300253334-New-orleans-jack-sheldon-and-his-all</w></i><x></x></a>
