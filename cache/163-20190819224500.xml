Clear may be considered crazy, but she's not wrong. Death is moving toward suburban Route 23, heading south. En route to a weekend getaway with her friends, Kimberly Corman watches helplessly as a logging truck careens out of control and loses its deadly payload, setting off a horrifying chain reaction that leaves twisted metal and dead bodies in its wake--including her own. A moment later, Kimberley finds herself still stuck in on-ramp traffic, with a line of commuters she saw die moments before. It was only a vision, but was it a warning? Shocked into action, Kimberly blocks the cars from joining the traffic on Route 23. The commuters begin to honk and complain--until Kimberly's premonition comes true. Death tears up the highway in a massive pile-up, with those left on the on-ramp narrowly escaping with their lives. But Kimberly knows it s not over. Death will not be cheated so easily for this random group of strangers who must join Kimberly in a race against time to do what all but one of the survivors of Flight 180 couldn't--stay alive.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20190819/1310241746-Final-destination-2</w></i><x></x></a>
