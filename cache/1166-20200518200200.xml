Hosted annually in Bremen, Germany, it brings together musicians, bookers, agents, organizers, jazz experts, and music enthusiasts. In 2019, jazzahead! pays special attention to Norway by selecting 40 jazz acts from all over the world and inviting them to perform over the course of three days. Among them is Trio Abozekrys. This trio was founded in 2018, when oud player Mohamed Abozekry proposed a new trio formula. Accompanied by his brother Abdallah Abozekry on saz and Nicolas Thé on drums, they perform a jazz-inflected repertoire that is inspired by the music of the Near East. The Abozekry brothers grew up playing music from the Near East, whereas drummer Nicolas Thé emphasizes the jazzy grooves inherent in this music.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200518/1400168795-Trio-abozekrys-jazzahead</w></i><x></x></a>
