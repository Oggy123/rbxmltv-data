With its timeless sound, the group offers a completely new interpretation of folk and blues. The band's name refers to an early series of recordings set in a timber-framed cabin in the wooded outskirts of Ontario. The cinematic and agonizing sound of the band has been described as &quot;an aesthetic rooted in swampy, ragged blues&quot; and &quot;beautifully restrained blues from an alternate universe&quot;.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200601/1410020759-Une-soiree-de-poche-timber-timbre</w></i><x></x></a>
