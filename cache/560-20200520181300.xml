In the breathtaking surroundings of Vienna's Hofburg Palace, the Wiener Akademie period orchestra, conducted by Alfred Eschwe, plays some of the Strauss family's and Joseph Lanner's favorite pieces, including &quot;The Beautiful Blue Danube&quot;, &quot;Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka&quot;, and the &quot;Radetzky March&quot;. Former residence of the Habsburg dynasty, the Hofburg contained the apartments of Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elizabeth. A Night in Vienna features soloist Lesley Garrett, the most popular soprano from the UK. The spirit of the Strauss era is perfectly recreated by the addition of waltz dancers adorned with historical costumes. This concert was presented in 2004, under the direction of David Amphlett.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200520/1400191418-A-night-in-vienna</w></i><x></x></a>
