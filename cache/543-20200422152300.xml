His distinctive guitar picking style and instantly recognisable voice are joined to his dynamic on stage presence to deliver a show that brings the audience to their feet and leaves them calling for more. Starting with five solo acoustic performances, Lindsey is then joined by his band to rock their way through the rest of the set before a final acoustic encore of “Seeds We Sow” brings a perfect evening to an end.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200422/1390435225-Songs-from-small-machine-live-in-l-a</w></i><x></x></a>
