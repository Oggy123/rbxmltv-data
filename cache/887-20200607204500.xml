There are still a number of places to witness displays of the energy of volcanoes. Our program host walks through the forest in mid-winter, and discovers traces of surviving wild animals. Further, they head to the place where an unusual environment is kept due to the geothermal activity. Later, we show you rare footage of some striking scenery created by the extreme winter conditions on Lake Kussharo, as well as a unique hot spring at the lakeside where migratory birds gather.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/nhk-world-tv/20200607/1410435703-Wild-hokkaido</w></i><x></x></a>
