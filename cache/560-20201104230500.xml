The performance ends with Chopin's technically demanding Ballade No. 4, Op. 52. Prosseda is particularly noted for his performances of newly discovered works by Mendelssohn and has recorded a nine-CD series for Decca of the piano works of Mendelssohn. Since 2012, Prosseda also gives lecture-concerts with the robot pianist TeoTronico, as educational or family concerts, to demonstrate differences between a literal production of music and human interpretation.</d></p><i><t>Seri√°l</t><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20201104/1460228203-Prosseda-performs-mozart-schubert-chopin</w></i><x></x></a>
