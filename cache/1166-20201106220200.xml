Discover an irresistible live act; STUFF is full of unflagging energy. The Belgian band was founded in 2012 when drummer Lander Gyselinck was asked to play live music between DJ sets at a local bar. He gathered a bunch of friends, who also were musicians. The band could be considered an avant-garde jazz band who play a mix of funk, hip-hop, and electro. Andrew Claes (saxophone), Dries Laheye (bass guitar), Lander Gyselinck (drums), Mixmonster Menno (samples), and Joris Caluwaerts (keyboards) share an exceptional connection in music.
