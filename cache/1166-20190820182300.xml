2018. Incognito. Sing Jazz, Singapore</k><d>An acid jazz project rooted in the 1970s jazz/funk/soul world, Incognito was originally formed by Jean-Paul &quot;Bluey&quot; Maunick and Paul &quot;Tubbs&quot; Williams. Both were original members of the late 1970s disco/funk group Light of the World. They decided to take a couple of their jams into the studio and debuted with the single Parisienne Girl. Decades later, Incognito's cover of Boz Scaggs' classic Lowdown with Chaka Khan and Mario Biondi saw the band's international status grow more and more popular. At Sing Jazz 2018, Incognito takes a fresh direction on classic musical themes, giving their fans an unforgettable live show!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190820/1310324436-Incognito-sing-jazz-2018</w></i><x></x></a>
