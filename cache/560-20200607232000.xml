This performance took place at Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Snape Bridge in the UK in 2017. This five-part orchestral suite was originally as a piano duet in 1910, but the composer orchestrated the work the year after. Ravel originally composed the work as a piano duet for the two children of Polish sculptor Gobeski and dedicated the work for four hands to the children.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200607/1410027892-Ravel-mother-goose-suite</w></i><x></x></a>
