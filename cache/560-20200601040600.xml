It portrays extraordinary composers who were active in the cultural city of Vienna and deserve the label of genius. In Papa &amp; Wolfgang (Part 1) we follow the lives and work of &quot;Papa&quot; Josef Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In 18th century Vienna, a dynasty was born from the unbreakable bond between these two extraordinary men of music. It was a bond forged from respect and friendship. Learn how their individual skills and imagination grew and flourished; how their friendship and mutual respect took their music to places then unimagined; how their joy of life and living molded Vienna's unique musical culture. Their story is told against the background of their time.</d></p><i><t>Seri√°l</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200601/1400610371-Sons-of-vienna-part-1-papa-wolfgang</w></i><x></x></a>
