On the program are Beethoven's Symphony No. 6, and Violin Concerto, Op. 61. The award-winning Isabelle Faust is the soloist, and since her recordings with Claudio Abbado, she's the first choice when it comes to this masterpiece. Beethoven composed his Symphony No. 6 between 1802 and 1808. Nicknamed &quot;Pastoral Symphony,&quot; this piece is one of the few examples of program music for the German composer. Unlike other Beethoven symphonies, this piece has not four, but five movements, each with a programmatic title.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200608/1410033157-Easter-concert-in-baden-baden-2015</w></i><x></x></a>
