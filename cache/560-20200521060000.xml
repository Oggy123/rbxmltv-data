Musicians with a passion for virtuosity and a willingness to expand their repertoire have made the piano popular again. In addition to the usual classics they perform formerly scorned works or they discover neglected composers. Legato is a series dedicated to four fascinating pianists - their individual approaches, their fresh ideas and their music. Today in the focus: Pierre-Laurent Aimard, the French specialist for classical and avantgarde music. Johann Sebastian Bach: The Art of the Fugue BWV 1080, Nos. 4, 10, 12, 14; Elliott Carter: Matribute, Two Diversions; George Benjamin: Shadowlines I - VI; Ludwig van Beethoven: Sonata in A flat Major, Op. 110.</d></p><i><t>Seriál</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200521/1400209280-Legato-world-of-the-piano</w></i><x></x></a>
