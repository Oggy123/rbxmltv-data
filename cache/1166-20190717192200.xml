A wide variety of visiting international jazz musicians share their art of making jazz music with us in the DJAZZ series 'Belgium Sessions'. In these sessions, some of Europe's finest musicians perform their own, original music. This episode MotorMusic invites the jazz trio 'WRaP!', consisting of singer Barbara Wiernik, guitarist Alain Pierre, and Chet Baker's former bassist: Jean-Louis Rassinfosse. The trio plays one of their most beautiful compositions of 'Endless'. In this fine composition, Wiernik's beautiful voice, Pierre's crystal chords of the 12-string guitar, and the warm sounds of the contrabass come to full bloom.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190717/1300253338-Motormusic-jazz-sessions-wrap</w></i><x></x></a>
