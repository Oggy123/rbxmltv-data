Lintu studied piano and cello at the Sibelius Academy and the Turku conservatorium in Sweden's southeast. He started conducting at the Sibelius Academy. His many concerts with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra in 2012 made him the obvious replacement for Sakari Oramo, who, after many years as conductor and concert master, terminated his contract in 2012. The orchestra specializes in the performance of Finnish music, but also performs the great masterpieces of Gustav Mahler and Béla Bartók. The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius is the orchestra's favourite, as well as the conductor. In cooperation with Finland's national public broadcasting company Yle, all seven Sibelius symphonies are recorded and broadcast. After a brief spoken introduction about the piece, the orchestra performs the complete symphony. In many ways, Sibelius' seventh and last Symphony is his best symphony. As its parts are logical extensions of each other, the Symphony was clearly conceived as a unity. Despite its relative brevity, its compositional style is a clear precursor to the direction future great composers would take, among whom Anton Webern. Although all Sibelius's seven symphonies were glorious, they do not dominate his complete oeuvre. His Violin concerto and his symphonic poem 'Finlandia' have received much more fame and popularity.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200607/1410027879-Sibelius-symphony-no-7</w></i><x></x></a>
