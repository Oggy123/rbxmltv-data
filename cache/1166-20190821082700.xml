1992. Jill Fredrickson. New Orleans, U.S.A.</k><d>Denver-based Ellyn Rucker is one of the finest female singer-pianists around, and this 1992 performance raises the question why she is not a world-wide favourite drawing sell-out crowds, much like a Diana Krall would. Perhaps it is because Ellyn's puts her Bill Evans-like piano improvisations in the spotlight rather than her vocals, as she does on the opening numbers of today's set: &quot;Beautiful Love&quot;, &quot;Israel&quot;, and &quot;Take the Coltrane&quot;. Yet this broadcast leaves ample room for her voice to shine as well, when she scats her inimitable way through a set of standards that include &quot;Up Jumped Spring&quot; and the calypso &quot;Fungi Mamma&quot;.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190821/1310335958-Ellyn-rucker-live-in-new-orleans</w></i><x></x></a>
