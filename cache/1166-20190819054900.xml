2018. Cedric Leonardi, Tony Jean Reyes, Kakou Reyes &amp; Manjoor Khan Dholak. Sing Jazz, Singapore</k><d>Since the Gypsy Kings made their triumphal debut on the music scene with their wild Spanish rumba four decades ago, no band has dared to follow in their footsteps ... until now! House of the Gipsies updates the raw rhythms of nomadic tribes in Rajasthan, India, collaborating with Manganiyar musicians Manjoor, Nehru and Dilawar Khan. The result is a unique sound that can be described as Indo-Gypsy fusion, which is part of the evolution of the Spanish rumba. Do not miss this eclectic performance sure to please music lovers of all generations, presented at the 2018 Sing Jazz Festival.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190819/1310312864-House-of-the-gipsies-sing-jazz-2018</w></i><x></x></a>
