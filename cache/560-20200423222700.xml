Directed by Barry Gavin, this concert took place at the Berliner Philharmonie in 1992. Mahler was inspired by Jean Paul's novel Titan, in which an artistically gifted young man, driven by his failure to find his way in society, eventually commits suicide in despair. The genesis of this work was not easy for Mahler: he composed it between 1887 and 1888, at the time when he was conductor of the Leipzig opera. The first version of the work first took the form of a two-part symphonic poem and premiered in Budapest in 1898. However, the work was poorly received by the public and critics, which forced Mahler to revise it. The new version resulted in the wonderful Symphony No. 1 that we know today, an incredible achievement for such a young composer.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200423/1390289975-Mahler-symphony-no-1</w></i><x></x></a>
