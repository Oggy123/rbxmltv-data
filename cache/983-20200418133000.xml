Incorporating six stages over six days, the race weaves its way up and down the Andalucia mountains at a blistering pace, routing through spectacular trails and sensational views. Elite and masters race categories offer individual and team leader board standings, with daily stage prizes, overall medals and prize money for the elite UCI riders. The pace of the competition never slows across the six stages, kicking off with the stage 1 time trial; a short, fast and intense ‘flash stage’, featuring single tracks mixed with overtaking sections. Five days, 32 kilometres and over 6,590 meters of ascent later, the 57.8km ‘finisher’ stage 6 is the final test, as riders climb over 1,396 meters up the mythical Reventón and pass through Trasierra, before descending and finishing along Santo Domingo’s unforgettable single-track trail. Riders choose their risks to secure an advantage, all the time fully conscious that one mistake navigating the rocky trails means their race is over. Winning this 9th edition of the Andalucia Bike Race, were Spain’s David Valero in the men’s elite, with Hildegunn Hovdenak of Norway tacking victory in the women’s elite.</d></p><i><t>Sport</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/fast-funbox-hd/20200418/1390343965-Andalucia-bike-race-2019</w></i><x></x></a>
