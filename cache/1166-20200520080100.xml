The music is inspired by both traditional and modern music from Ntjam's home country Cameroon, (Manu Dibango and Richard Bona) as well as by an Afro-European blend of soul, jazz, gospel and world music. Using unorthodox sounds as the basis of their compositions, Artvark continues to be radical, experimenting with alternative ways of playing the sax. For this project, they explore the world of electronics and effects to create new sounds. Ntjam's role is divers. She is the quartet's fifth instrument, recites spoken word, plays (vocal) percussion, forms duos or trios with the saxophones and accompanies the quartet on her guitar. She performs texts in English as well as in French, one of Cameroon's official languages, and sings in Bulu, her mother tongue.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200520/1400201041-Artvark-saxophone-quartet-ntjam-rosie-homelands</w></i><x></x></a>
