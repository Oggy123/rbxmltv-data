The trumpet player of Swiss origin, Erik Truffaz,is one of the first European jazzmen to have successfully approached drum'n'bass. In 1991 he founded a quartet which today is composed of Benoît Corboz (keyboards), Marcello Giuliani (bass) and Marc Erbetta (drums and percussion),he explores electronic jazz-fusion much in the same way as Miles Davis and recorded several albums starting from 1994. After an incursion into into rock at the head of his Ladybird Quartet created in 2001, he returned to the formula which had made him successful. In his world, always deeply influenced by Miles Davis, the stridencies of rock alternate with the poetic respites, the rousing grooves with more calm ballads.
