Powerful, whisky-throated and raw, it drives home the sound, twinned with his super-watt harmonica playing. The Montreal artist arrives with songs from a new album released in 2013, Sweet Warm Jelly, a sonic jam of blues, jazz and gospel guaranteed to warm the heart. In 2002, he won Le Prix de la Releve at Festiblues International de Montr√©al leading the formation Riverside Blues. Then he toured France as an opening act for Mr. Bob Walsh. More recently, Martin played the Montreal International Jazz Festival, Sherblues Festival, au Tremblant International Blues Festival, Trois-Rivieres en Blues, Joliette's October Blues or as an opening act for the prince of soul and funk, Lee Fields.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200520/1400201049-Martin-goyette-spectacle-astral-2017</w></i><x></x></a>
