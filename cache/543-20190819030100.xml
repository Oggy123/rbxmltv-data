The show came on the back of the band's No.1 album &quot;Velociraptor!&quot; and the setlist combines tracks from that album with hits and classic album tracks from across their career so far. The concert was part of a sold out arena tour that covered the UK and Ireland at the end of last year. Kasabian are the recipients of numerous awards for &quot;Best Live Band&quot; and &quot;Best British Band&quot; in recent years and this new show with its spectacular and innovative staging will be a must have for their huge and dedicated fanbase.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190819/1310109148-Kasabian-live-at-the-o2</w></i><x></x></a>
