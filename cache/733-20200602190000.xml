Let’s step back in time for this new expedition that delves into the myths and legends of the white continent... &quot; The Great North has always fascinated explorers. Since the beginning of time, these icy lands have represented a hostile yet mythical frontier. For this new expedition, Francis Le Guen and his crew head off on the trail of the fabled Viking navigators. These great explorers were the first to reach the extreme North, Septentrion. Conducting the inquiry, Francis Le Guen leads his team on the trail of the most famous adventurous Viking, Erik the Red. On the sea or on the ice, in the heart of geysers or chasms, amidst orcs and narwhals, we discover the remaining clues of Viking culture where they stayed. From this geographical and naturalistic itinerary all the Nordic mythology comes into view. But during this journey, the crew, surrounded by breathtaking scenery, makes investigations through time. Their goal: to discover just who these men were. How far north did they actually travel?</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200602/1410106507-Destination-wilderness-arctic-sepentrion</w></i><x></x></a>
