Next to a firm base of jazz as the festival's staple music genre, many others, such as blues, soul, funk, or hip hop, pass by. The Dave Brubeck Quartet gave an unforgettable performance at the North Sea Jazz Festival of 1982. The open-eared American pianist was one of the first to weave elements from both classical and African music into his improvisations and compositions. Known the world over for the million-selling 1961 crossover hit 'Take Five', the earlier, third stream-like output of his late 1940s Octet shows the origins of this ever-adventurous artist. Original Dave Brubeck Octet clarinettist Bill Smith (1926-2020) joined Brubeck for his 1982 North Sea Jazz Festival concert.</d></p><i><w>https://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20201101/1460050224-Dave-brubeck-quartet-the-north-sea-jazz</w></i><x></x></a>
