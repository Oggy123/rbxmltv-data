Catch the latest from odor sensors using moth antennae to power generators using electric rays.</k><d>Biomimetics which model the remarkable abilities of living organisms has progressed into research that directly transfers nature's abilities onto machines. Learn how an odor-detecting machine equipped with the antennae of a real silkworm moth is able to find its way to the source of a smell. We'll focus on other surprising research including a power generating system that uses the organs of electric rays.
