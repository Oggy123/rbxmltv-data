Set in the scenario of a Western film production, this is the second directorial work of Rolando Villazón.</k><d>With Rolando Villazón directing and playing the title role, the world rushed for tickets to the Baden-Baden 2012 Pentecost-holiday opera. Following his directorial debut in 2011 (Werther, Lyon) the Mexican tenor went a step further, staging Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore and directing himself in the role of Nemorino. The film tells the story of this &quot;story within a story&quot; and reveals the creative process of staging the comic opera in two acts at the Festspielhaus Baden-Baden in April and May 2012. We follow Rolando Villazón in rehearsals with singers and actors, and in his exchanges with young conductor Pablo Heras-Casado on the way to a highly personal performance.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200417/1390155898-Donizetti-l-elisir-d-amore</w></i><x></x></a>
