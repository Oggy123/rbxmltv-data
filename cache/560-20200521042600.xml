During his career he composed over a hundred symphonies which gave him the title 'Father of the Symphony', but he has also been a key figure in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio. Haydn is still very famous for his 68 string quartets that he wrote between 1762 and 1803. 'Father of the String Quartet' is therefore also a title that describes Haydn as a composer. The British String Quartet The Lindsays have recorded all substantial Haydn String Quartets during their active years, from 1965 to 2005. Besides Haydn, there are an extensive list of highly praised recordings such as Beethoven String Quartets, but also String Quartets by Mozart, Schubert and Dvorak. In 2004 they recorded seven Haydn String Quartets for television at the Kuhmo Arts Centre in Finland. One of them is Haydn's String Quartet in G Major Op. 54 No.2. Opus 54 is named 'The Tost Quartets', dedicated to violinist Johann Tost, a violinist in the Esterhazy orchestra from 1783 to 1789.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200521/1400209279-Haydn-string-quartet-in-c-major-op-54-no-2</w></i><x></x></a>
