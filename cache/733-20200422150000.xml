With its surface being 96% covered by an impenetrable jungle, it is the location of much trafficking. While the police work to dismantle the prominent drug trafficking networks, the environmental police track down poachers, whose activity is particularly intense. Their searches bring them in daily contact with the Garimpeiros, illegal Brazilian immigrants who work at gold panning sites, in contradiction with the law. Gold trafficking therefore doubles up as weapons trafficking and prostitution.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200422/1390342214-Postcard-perfect-guyana</w></i><x></x></a>
