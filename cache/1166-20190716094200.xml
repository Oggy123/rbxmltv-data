2017. Richard Lems. Amsterdam, The Netherlands</k><d>Amsterdam, February 6th, 2018 - The short documentary Rebirth in The Amsterdam Red Light District illustrates how brutal Richard Lems' life as an addict was and his struggle to unshackle himself from the shame. Filled with fierce, freighting, and sad moments, Richard relives his stabbing, stay in jail, drug test, and drug use. Richard expresses himself verbally but mainly relives the moments through drumming, which renders the documentary an intense and unique experience. Addiction doctor and musician Gerard Alderliefste: &quot;If he dares to bottom out, he will see it was the drugs and not himself. Music can bring those emotions to the surface&quot;.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190716/1300244140-Rebirth-richard-lemz</w></i><x></x></a>
