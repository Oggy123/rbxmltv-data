At the time of their composition, Beethoven was already locked in himself by his deafness. This deeply affected his relationship to others and to the world. This &quot;psychological framework&quot; is explored by director Mariano Nante, setting pianist Alexandre Tharaud in a film inspired by the universe of Tarkovski. Filmed in abandoned castles, and lit by director of photography Yorgos Arvanitis, this work evokes solitude and introspection and offers an inner journey through images and music.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200416/1390145941-Beethoven-last-sonatas-op-109-110-111</w></i><x></x></a>
