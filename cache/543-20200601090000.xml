Filmed in June 2010 in the intimate surroundings of New York's famous Roseland Ballroom, this is a real chance to get up close and personal as Phil Collins faithfully recreates the soul and Motown classics that he loved as a teenager. His band includes three of Motown's original backing band The Funk Brothers: Bob Babbitt on bass and guitarists Eddie Willis and Ray Monette, as well as two stalwarts of Genesis' live shows: Chester Thompson on drums and Darryl Stuermer on guitars. The result is an uplifting performance that moves at its own pace, rarely veering into inferior cover or pure nostalgia territory.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200601/1410025107-Going-back-live-at-roseland-ballroom-nyc</w></i><x></x></a>
