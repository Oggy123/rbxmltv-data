Mozart originally composed the symphony as a serenade for the family of Sigmund Haffner, a childhood friend from Salzburg in 1782. The composer made some revisions in the following year, adding multiple instruments and conducted the premiere of the four-movement piece on March 23, 1783, in Vienna. The &quot;Haffner&quot; Symphony, as it is known now, is a transitional work in Mozart's career. The work was meant to be party music for Salzburg and was transformed into a symphony for Vienna.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200521/1400209283-Mozart-symphony-no-35-k-385</w></i><x></x></a>
