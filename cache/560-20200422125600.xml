Mozart received a commission for three quartets in 1785 from publisher Franz Anton Hoffmeister. Hoffmeister thought the first quartet (K. 478) was too difficult and the public would not like it. He released Mozart from the obligation of completing the three quartets. However, nine months later, Mozart composed this second quartet anyway.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200422/1390264419-Mozart-piano-quartet-no-1-k-478</w></i><x></x></a>
