He desperately wants to fit in, yet, the terrible irony is the more he tries to be like every other money-drenched man on Wall Street, the more faceless he becomes -- and the less control he has over the urges that, ironically, make him feel like an individual. Bateman is a paragon of conformity in an amoral society where to conform is to be amoral.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200423/1390407445-American-psycho</w></i><x></x></a>
