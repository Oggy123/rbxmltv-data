Universal Studios, Waterloo, Belgium</k><d>Rahsaan Roland Kirk: Live in '64 presents an astounding concert by this musical superhero playing his entire instrumental arsenal of saxophone, flute, manzello, stritch, clarinet, siren and whistlesâ€” oftentimes simultaneously! Kirk is backed by extraordinary side musicians such as legendary bassist Guy Pederson, drummer Daniel Humair and long-time pianist George Gruntz who keep the fire and swing burning throughout Rahsaan's blazing workouts.
