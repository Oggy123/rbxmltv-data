The hugely talented young pianist Dan Tepfer makes his solo London debut in the lustrous acoustic of the Wigmore Hall, performing his much admired interpretation of J.S. Bach's masterpiece, with the original music complemented by Tepfer's own improvised response.
Tepfer's duet with the veteran saxophonist Lee Konitz was a highlight of the 2013 Jazz Festival, his lightning-fast reactions to the jazz master's unpredictably fascinating twists and turns proving a revelation. Already the recipient of multiple awards, his mix of the gorgeous and the vivacious, lyricism balanced with swing is the signature of an emerging jazz star.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/mezzo-live-hd/20190715/1300113477-Jazz</w></i><x></x></a>
