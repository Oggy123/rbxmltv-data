After a miraculous haul of ‘rice-fish’ in the South China Sea, where the river ends its own journey, he goes into the delta to meets some prawn fishermen, or ‘aquatic tramps’ as they are known locally. Christophe then boards a taxi-boat and goes to the floating market of Can Thô. After accompanying a family on its way to sell pineapples on the ‘nine-dragon river’, he arrives at the border and leaves the bustle of Vietnam behind him. In Cambodia, he returns to dry land and gets to know some unusual salesmen who have come from India to sell mosquito nets. Finally, our explorer ends his voyage in the gemstone mines of Ratanakiri.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200422/1390342207-Nomad-s-land-mekong</w></i><x></x></a>
