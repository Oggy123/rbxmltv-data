Michael's impeccable vocals take center stage, and his pop-song prowess is driven home with such classics as &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;One More Try&quot;. Even &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; gets a nod, as does the Police's &quot;Roxanne&quot;.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190820/1310109171-George-michael-live-in-london</w></i><x></x></a>
