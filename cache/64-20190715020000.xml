On the menu: games and homemade pies. At least that’s what Lola is hoping because Honorine bakes the best pies in town! But of course, the Guanos have their eyes on the delicious pies and want their share. As Pat fights with the Guanos to save the pastries, Honorine decides Pat is actually attacking the birds and locks him in her cellar. Now both Hoodie and the delicious pies are at the pigeons’ mercy. But Pat hasn't had his last word and has plans to save the day – and especially the pies!</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/boomerang/20190715/1300018561-Pat-the-dog</w></i><x></x></a>
