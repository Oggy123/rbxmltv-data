It is home to the mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who unified Japan and founded the Tokugawa shogunate in the beginning of the 17th century. In the mid-19th century, after a period of isolation, Japan resumed international relations. Nikko soon became one of the most sought-after summer playgrounds for Westerners due to its abundant nature and cool climate. On this episode of Journeys in Japan we explore architectural jewels that quietly reveal Nikko's history, including the Nikko Toshogu Shrine where Tokugawa Ieyasu is enshrined, former villas of foreign embassies, and a classic hotel.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/nhk-world-tv/20190716/1300742904-Journeys-in-japan</w></i><x></x></a>
