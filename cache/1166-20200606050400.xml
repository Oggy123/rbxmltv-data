Two of the group's own compositions develop into hypnotic grooves, successfully pushing the boundaries of jazz.</k><d>The line-up of the Julie Campiche Quartet is unconventional to say the least: Julie Campiche on harp, Leo Fumagalli on saxophone, Manu Hagmann on bass, and Clemens Kuratle on drums and percussion, with Kuratle deftly incorporating electronics into their individual sound. To say that the quartet takes its listeners on a musical journey is not an overstatement. During two performances (Campiche's &quot;Onkalo&quot; and Kuratle's &quot;To The Holy Land&quot;) from the Schaffhauser Jazz Festival on May 24, 2018, the Quartet slowly develops hypnotic grooves that features all the jazz sensibilities fans could wish for while still pushing the boundaries of what constitutes jazz.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200606/1410026403-Julie-campiche-schaffhauser-jazz-festival-2018</w></i><x></x></a>
