But Hitler had expelled Einstein from Germany, and his own scientists could not do it. Strangely, Argentina, which had been neutral during the war and thanks to that had accumulated big reserves, was now importing scientists and technicians from the extinct Third Reich. The goal: to continue working with the development of nuclear energy, taking orders from a new leader: General Juan Domingo Peron. When the Soviet Union did not have its first &quot;A&quot; bomb yet, Argentina was already working on the development of nuclear energy through a unique and innovative method: &quot;Nuclear controlled Fusion&quot; By the use of this method, Argentina would be able to stock up energy unlimitedly and vastly more powerful than with the American one. The fact is, that at the beginning of 1951, Argentina announced the world the success of its first secret nuclear plan rising not only local press interest but also international In the Pink House, President J. D. Peron together with the Austrian Scientist Ronald Richter, stated that on February 16th 1951, in the remote Huemul Island, in the Argentine Patagonia, the first controlled nuclear fusion of history was performed. Peron was daydreaming about a nuclear propelled submarine made in Argentina How about a blue and white atomic bomb... ?</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200606/1410106644-Projekt-huemul-fourth-reich-in-argentina</w></i><x></x></a>
