Hamel is backed by big band Sven Happel (double bass), Jasper van Hulten (drums), Gijs Anders van Straalen (percussion), Rory Ronde (guitar), Benjamin Herman (saxophone), and a string ensemble. Hamel plays the guitar, piano, sings, and writes many of his own songs. He made his debut in 2007 with the eponymous album Hamel on Dox Records; it was a hit on the Dutch albums chart, remained on the Top 20 for over a year, and spawned the hit &quot;As Long as We're in Love&quot;. The show was recorded at the legendary venue Paradiso, a former church considered the &quot;pop temple&quot; of the Netherlands. Hamel's performance of &quot;One More Time on the Merry-Go-Round&quot; perfectly connects the beautiful venue in the heart of Amsterdam and the enthousiastic audience.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200521/1400219681-Wouter-hamel-live-in-paradiso</w></i><x></x></a>
