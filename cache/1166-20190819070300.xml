2016. Rembrandt Frerichs, Cello8tet Amsterdam, Hossein Alizadeh &amp; Tony Overwater. Verkadefabriek, Den Bosch, The Netherlands</k><d>The November Music festival in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands is the ultimate event for experiencing a broad range of music. It features a wonderful variety of contemporary and experimental pop, sound art, non-Western music, jazz and free improvisation. The closing concert for the 2016 edition offers a great example of this musical wealth - Dutch composer and pianist Rembrandt Frerichs' fantastic trio play a wonderful set with Cello8ctet Amsterdam and renowned Iranian tar player Hossein Alizâdeh. Rembrandt Frerichs studied in New York and lived in Cairo for several years. His music has the drive of American jazz, the lyricism of Middle-Eastern music, and the sensitivity of the chamber music of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. The combination of Frerichs' trio with Cello8ctet and Alizâdeh is unique. Their music is a miracle of organic creativity, and a shining fusion of old and new world music.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190819/1310312865-November-music-r-frerichs-h-alizadeh</w></i><x></x></a>
