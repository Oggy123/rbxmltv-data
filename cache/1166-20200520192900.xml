(2006)</k><d>In this DJAZZ.tv Belgium Sessions performance, which was recorded at AED Studios in Lint, Belgium, we witness Europe's finest jazz musicians at work. A wide variety of international jazz musicians give a creative, up-close and inside insight into their art of playing jazz music. Young talent and established jazz musicians play to their heart's content: take for instance this unusual performance by Saxkartel. This band plays jazz and modern music with an uncommon approach: as a saxophone quartet, they perform chamber-like music without the accompaniment of a rhythm section. Their approach is similar to that of the classical string quartet, but their choice of repertoire clearly sets them apart: they play pure jazz!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200520/1400201052-Belgium-sessions-saxkartel</w></i><x></x></a>
