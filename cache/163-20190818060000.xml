A battle with the local Indians rages while Donahue is involved with both McBain and Pleshette. The latter is the lucky girl who hitches heart-throb Donahue. This film was, unfortunately, a less-than-glorious exit for the great Raoul Walsh, who simply made a B-western on a big budget. Astonishing color photography of the Red Rocks region and the Painted Desert. Also interesting is the use of the Indians' native language complete with subtitles.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20190818/1310241725-A-distant-trumpet</w></i><x></x></a>
