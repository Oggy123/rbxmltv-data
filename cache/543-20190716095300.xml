They were instantly successful and released a string of hit albums, with an ever changing line-up, between 1975 and 1983 when Blackmore broke up the group to join the reformed Deep Purple. This concert from their European tour in 1977 features the line-up responsible for the “Long Live Rock’n’Roll” album released later that year, including vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Cozy Powell. Blackmore had to be smuggled out of Austria after a trouble with the police at a gig two nights earlier and was very late arriving in Munich, all of which seemed to inspire both the band and the audience to create a truly remarkable gig.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190716/1300146994-Rainbow-live-in-munich-1977</w></i><x></x></a>
