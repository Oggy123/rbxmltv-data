The concert was recorded in December of 2016 at the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow and features Borodin's In the Steppes of Central Asia, and Khachaturyan's Piano Concerto in D-flat Major and &quot;Adagio from Spartacus and Phrygia&quot; (transcription for piano and orchestra). The programme is produced by the Moscow Philharmonic Society, which Saint Petersburg-born composer Dmitri Shostakovich himself once described as playing a significant role &quot;in the development of musical life [in Russia]. It is a kind of university which is attended by millions of music lovers and thousands of musicians.&quot; The Moscow Philharmonic Society was founded in 1922 by then-Commissar for Culture, Anatoly Lunacharsky, and has over the years come to be Russia's leading concert organizing institution.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200608/1410033154-Khachaturyan-piano-concerto-borodin</w></i><x></x></a>
