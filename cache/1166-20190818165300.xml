1963. Cannonball Adderley. Lugano, Switzerland</k><d>Cannonball Adderley: Live in '63 boasts two beautifully filmed concerts from one of the most celebrated sextets in jazz history, captured at the top of their game. Cannonball Adderley (alto sax), Nat Adderley (cornet) and the masterful Yusef Lateef (tenor sax, flute, oboe), provide a massive three-horn frontline attack, while the stellar rhythm section featuring a pre-Weather Report Joe Zawinul (piano), Sam Jones (bass) and Louis Hayes (drums) fuel the songs with a deep infectious swing. Quincy Jones' 'Jessica's Day' leaps from the gate with a huge 'big band' sound that is extraordinary for only six musicians. This recording is a reminder that Cannonball Adderley was one of the most outstanding and highly respected alto saxophonists in the history of jazz, a blues-based jazzman who could play anything in superb fashion.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190818/1310298210-Cannonball-adderley-sextet-switzerland</w></i><x></x></a>
