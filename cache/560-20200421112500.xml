Beethoven's last three sonatas mark a culmination in the classical-romantic sonata form, and it is also Beethoven's farewell to the genre. The composer not only aesthetically and emotionally heralds the arrival of the Romantic Age in music but also profoundly alters what had been the accepted parameters of sonata form. Because of these three works, it was possible for Liszt to create his Sonata in B minor. Leonskaja began her studies at the Moscow Conservatory in 1964, during which she won multiple international prizes. In 1978 Leonskaja left the Soviet Union and has resided in Vienna, Austria, since then.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200421/1390247447-Pianomania-elisabeth-leonskaja</w></i><x></x></a>
