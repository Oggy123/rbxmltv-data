<a><n>Kurt Rosenwinkel meets Peter Beets Trio</n><s o="2020-04-23 04:27:00" d="2020-04-23 05:35:00" n="DJazz" id_tv="1166"></s><p><d>The Dutch world-class jazz pianist Peter Beets has shared the stage with jazz greats like Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, &quot;Toots&quot; Thielemans, Elvin Jones, George Coleman, Johnny Griffin, Benny Golson and John Clayton. From birth, Beets was surrounded by music: he heard classical music from his mother, who is a music pedagogue, and he heard jazz from his father, who has a great fan of Oscar Peterson and Art Blakey. Although Beets' parents originally did not associate the word &quot;musician&quot; with the word &quot;career&quot;, music is definitely in the family's blood. At this concert at the Kurhaus in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, Peter Beets teams up with the world-famous guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel. With a career spanning almost twenty-five years and including collaborating with dynamic peers like Brad Mehldau, Brian Blade, Mark Turner, Joshua Redman, Chris Potter, as well as esteemed jazz legends like Joe Henderson, Paul Motian and Gary Burton, Rosenwinkel's indelible mark in music is the consummation of being steeped in the rich and deep traditions of jazz, springing off of the shoulders of such vital underpinnings to elevate his own art to new heights, evolving the language in a way no other guitarist has since his arrival. This collaboration between Beets and Rosenwinkel guarantees brilliant music.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200423/1390301387-Kurt-rosenwinkel-meets-peter-beets-trio</w></i><x></x></a>
