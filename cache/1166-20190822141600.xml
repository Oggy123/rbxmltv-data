2006. Clark Terry, Roy Hargrove &amp; Chris Botti. LRS Media Studios, Chicago, Unites States</k><d>With the exception of DJAZZ.tv, there is hardly any jazz on television. Jazz pianist and broadcaster Ramsey Lewis has addressed this vacuum with his programme series 'Legends of Jazz'. This interesting series brings together musicians who are not usually paired. The importance of the trumpet in jazz cannot be overstated, and the legends who have made their mark, from Louis Armstrong to Roy Eldridge, from Clifford Brown to Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis, are each discussed when three of the finest trumpet players in jazz join Ramsey Lewis on stage. What a wonderful cross section of trumpet sounds, from the legendary Clark Terry, who seems to make the trumpet actually talk when he plays, to the high-energy innovations of hard-bopping Roy Hargrove, to the romantic and intimate ballad playing of Chris Botti. This show will leave you feeling that you know much more about the trumpet than when you tuned in!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190822/1310367575-Legends-of-jazz-the-golden-horns</w></i><x></x></a>
