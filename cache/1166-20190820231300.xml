1964. Chet Baker, René Urtreger, Luigi Trussardi &amp; Franco Manzecchi. Universal Studios, Waterloo, Belgium</k><d>Chet Baker Quintet: Live in '64 features a great concert by the foremost interpreter of West Coast jazz in the early and mid-'50s. Chet Baker had a generally restrained, intimate playing style and attracted attention beyond jazz for his photogenic looks and great singing. However, his career was marred by drug addiction. This show is a haunting 1964 performance in a Belgian TV studio with a quartet including long-time sidemen and saxophonist Jacques Pelzer and French pianist René Urtreger. Songs include the Miles Davis classic &quot;So What&quot;, and a very rare rendition of jazz standard &quot;Time After Time&quot; featuring Chet's cool vocal style.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190820/1310324440-Chet-baker-quintet-live-in-64</w></i><x></x></a>
