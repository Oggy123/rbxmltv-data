The extensive program opens with the overture of Rossini's The Thieving Magpie and concludes with Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5. In between we are treated to renditions of Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain, Gerswhin's Rhapsody in Blue, Duke Ellington's C Jam Blues, Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, Barber's Adagio for Strings, Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee, the Adagietto of Mahler's Symphony No. 5, and Strauss' Emperor Waltz. Each of the evening's featured works has found its way onto the silver screen in one way or another. This concert was recorded at the Salle Pleyel, Paris, in 2014.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200605/1410022135-Classical-film-music</w></i><x></x></a>
