The band has made a number of visits to Montreux over the years and this concert from the 2013 Festival is undoubtedly one of their finest live performances. The set list blends tracks from early seventies albums such as &quot;Tres Hombres&quot; and &quot;Fandango&quot; through their eighties blockbuster period with &quot;Eliminator&quot; and &quot;Afterburner&quot; and up to their most recent release and return to their blues roots with &quot;La Futura&quot;. The middle section of the concert features a jazz-blues tribute to the late Montreux Festival founder Claude Nobs with guest appearances by Mike Flanigin on Hammond Organ and Van Wilks on guitar. ZZ Top, the &quot;lil’ ol’ band from Texas&quot;, are rocking the blues as strongly as ever!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190815/1310109088-Zz-top-live-at-montreux-2013</w></i><x></x></a>
