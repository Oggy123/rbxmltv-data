This concert's track listing spans their career from early tracks such as &quot;Waitin' For The Bus&quot;, &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; and the classic &quot;La Grange&quot;, through their eighties blockbusters including &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin'&quot; and &quot;Legs&quot; (complete with furry guitars!) and up to more recent hits like &quot;Pin Cushion&quot;. Filmed in their home state of Texas in front of a wildly enthusiastic audience, this concert captures ZZ Top at their very best.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200517/1400262964-Live-from-texas</w></i><x></x></a>
