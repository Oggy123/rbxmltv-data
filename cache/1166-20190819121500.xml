2017. Arnaud Spick-Saucier, Etienne Dextraze, Philippe Lussier-Baillargeon &amp; Alex Dodier. Monument-National, Montreal, Canada</k><d>Montreal's very own jazz group SHPIK offers a bold and impressionistic music, drawing its inspirations from jazz, nature, and film. Evoking the great outdoors, self-discovery, and navigating between the immense and the infinitely small, this first album offers an intricate musical journey that is both energetic and reflective. Consisting of pianist and composer Arnaud Spick-Saucier, bassist Etienne Dextraze, drummer Philippe Lussier-Baillargeon, and saxophonist/flutist Alex Dodier, SHPIK has performed at famous jazz events, including the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Do yourself a favour by not missing this extraordinary breath of fresh air.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190819/1310312869-Festival-vue-sur-la-releve-shpik</w></i><x></x></a>
