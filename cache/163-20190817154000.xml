At the request of Vincent Cadby, the English Consul General of the Bonai Province, Ace embarks on a perilous journey into the jungles of Africa with his constant companion, Spike the monkey, joined by the consul's portly emissary, the unflappable Fulton Greenwall.

If Ace fails, the result will be tribal war.
