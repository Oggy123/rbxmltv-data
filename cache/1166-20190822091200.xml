1957. Ella Fitzgerald, Herb Ellis, Ray Brown &amp; Jo Jones. Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, Belgium</k><d>'Ella Fitzgerald: Live in '57' features 'The First Lady Of Song' in a distinct performance. It's the earliest known complete concert of Ella to be captured on film. Shot in Belgium, this 1957 concert sees her performing with jazz greats Ray Brown, Herb Ellis, Jo Jones and the legendary Oscar Peterson on classics such as 'Lullaby Of Birdland' and 'It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)'. Although she wanted to be a dancer at first, Ella Fitzgerald already listened to recordings of Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters at an early age. After her debut at an amateur talent show in 1934, Ella joined Chick Webb's Orchestra with which she recorded several hits; after Webb died, she became the leader of the orchestra. In the late 1940s, Ella Fitzgerald became known as the 'First Lady of Song', with her wide vocal range of three octaves. The American jazz singer was particularly appreciated for her pure tone, intonation and phrasing, and unparalleled improvisational abilities. In a career that spanned close to 60 years, Fitzgerald sold 40 million albums and won 13 Grammy Awards, mainly for her definitive interpretations of the Great American Songbook.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190822/1310367571-Ella-fitzgerald-in-brussels-the</w></i><x></x></a>
