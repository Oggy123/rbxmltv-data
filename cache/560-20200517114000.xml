Rana opens with two works by Robert Schumann. His Blumenstück, Op. 19, is a short piano piece dating from 1839 and generally not included among the composer's more poetically inspired adventurous pieces. It is followed by the highly technically demanding Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13. After Schumann, Rana dives right into the 20th century with Maurice Ravel's impressionistic five-part suite for piano Miroirs. The concert concludes with Guido Agosti's transcription of Igor Stravinsky's Firebird Suite.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200517/1400643134-Pianomania-beatrice-rana</w></i><x></x></a>
