Coming two months after a Japanese tour that resulted in the &quot;Live in Japan&quot; album, Vaughan is heard performing such enduring classics as &quot;I Remember You,&quot; &quot;Summertime,&quot; and &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot; in addition to a humorously improvised version of &quot;Just A Gigolo.&quot; For the encore, Sarah herself plays piano on a version of &quot;Body and Soul.&quot;</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200523/1400280601-Sarah-vaughan-jazz-from-newport-brussels-1973</w></i><x></x></a>
