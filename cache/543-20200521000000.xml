So when we were given the opportunity to film Ben Harper accompanied by the blues-driven Texas trio Relentless7 at the Metro in Sydney, needless to say we were a little bit excited. And it may have been filmed in 2009, but this show was such a stand out favorite of ours there was no question that it was set to become one of our Classic Concerts someday.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200521/1400408771-Live-at-metro-theatre</w></i><x></x></a>
