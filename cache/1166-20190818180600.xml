1989. Stéphane Grappelli. New Orleans, U.S.A.</k><d>&quot;We're very happy and delighted to perform our music in this city where the jazz is born&quot;, Stephane Grappelli says at the opening of his set. Few jazz musicians retain the youthful exuberance at the advanced age of Stephane Grappelli at the time of this performance. This broadcast shows the old maestro in concert in an ensemble format that is reminiscent of the famous Hot Club du France, which Grappelli co-led with Django Rheinhart in the 1930s, as it features two guitars and a bass. Together with three young European musicians (guitarists Martin Taylor and Marc Fosset, and French bassist Patrice Caratini), Grappelli applies his unmistakable personal touch to graceful interpretations of a treasure chest of jazz standards – and even Chick Corea's &quot;Armando's Rhumba&quot; and Stevie Wonder's &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190818/1310298211-Stephane-grappelli-in-new-orleans</w></i><x></x></a>
