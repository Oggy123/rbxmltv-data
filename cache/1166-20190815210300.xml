2013. Alabama Shakes. The Metro Theatre, Sydney</k><d>Last year Alabama Shakes' debut record 'Boys &amp; Girls' arrived like a lightning bolt, seducing us with its blues-infused rock 'n' roots and Southern soul charms. It earned them gushing reviews, three Grammy nominations and high-profile fans like Robert Plant and Jack White. Watching them on stage, it's easy to see why. At their sold out Sydney gig, the Shakes were powerful, playful and gut-wrenchingly good. At the centre of it all lies Howard, a howling storm of soul and swagger, who proved as charming as she is cheeky. Your front row seat to this sublime show awaits... get comfy.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190815/1310258183-Alabama-shakes-live-at-the-metro</w></i><x></x></a>
