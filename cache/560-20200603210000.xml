The orchestra enchants, with multi-gifted musician Denis Matsuev, with performances of favorites like Rachmaninov's famous Piano Concerto No.2, the Symphonic Dances, and many more. Denis Matsuev, co-artistic director of the festival and artistic director of the Sergei Rachmaninov Foundation, interprets the Piano Concerto No. 2 virtuously and passionately. The tradition of the Annecy Classic Festival was born in 1967, initiated by the renowned French pianist Eliane Richepin. What started out as intimate performances by local musicians for local audiences has become a relevant cultural collaboration between France and Russia over the years.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200603/1410021739-Rachmaninov-the-last-romantic</w></i><x></x></a>
