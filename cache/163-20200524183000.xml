In Dr. Bruttenholm's secret Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.), Hellboy creates an unlikely family consisting of the telepathic &quot;Mer-Man&quot; Abe Sapien, and &quot;Pyrokenetic&quot; Liz Sherman, the woman he loves who can control fire. Hidden from the very society that they protect, they stand as the key line of defense against an evil madman who seeks to reclaim Hellboy to the dark side and use his powers to destroy mankind.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200524/1400494653-Hellboy</w></i><x></x></a>
