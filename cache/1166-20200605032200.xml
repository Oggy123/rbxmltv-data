The name Bixiga 70 is taken from a vibrant neighbourhood in downtown Sao Paulo. Organic, ritualistic, and sometimes even primal, the band's music appeals to those who seek out mental and physical freedom.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200605/1410023418-Bixiga-70-bird-2019</w></i><x></x></a>
