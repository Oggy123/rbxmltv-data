Part two of two. Following continued manipulation from Morgause, Cenred launches an attack on the citadel that places the fate of Camelot on Arthur's shoulders - but the initially strong counter-attack is overwhelmed when Morgana uses the enchanted rowan staff given to her by Morgause to summon a skeleton army from the vaults beneath the castle. Merlin hopes to put an end to the battle by stopping Morgana and vanquishing the enemy within - but must achieve his goal without revealing his magical powers.
