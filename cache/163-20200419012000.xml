Separated by clashing cultures and sprawling distances each of these four disparate groups of people are nevertheless hurtling towards a shared destiny of isolation and grief. In the course of just a few days they will each face the dizzying sensation of becoming profoundly lost--lost in the desert lost to the world lost to themselves--as they are pushed to the farthest edges of confusion and fear as well as to the very depths of connection and love.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/tcm-v-upc/20200419/1390407381-Babel</w></i><x></x></a>
