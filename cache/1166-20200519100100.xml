From birth, Beets was surrounded by music: he heard classical music from his mother, who is a music pedagogue, and he heard jazz from his father, who was a great fan of Oscar Peterson and Art Blakey. Although Beets' parents originally did not associate the word 'musician' with the word 'career', music is definitely in the family's blood. In this broadcast, Peter Beets teams up with double bassist Marius Beets (Peter's brother) and drummer Gijs Dijkhuizen. The trio presents Chopin's most beautiful melodies in a new and exciting way. Bluesy improvisations, swinging jazz rhythms and Chopin's harmonic fundaments appear to be a golden combination. Expect a fantastic Beetsian cross-over between the classical music from the late Romantic period and wonderful bebop style jazz improvisations.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200519/1400182387-Peter-beets-chopin-meets-the-blues</w></i><x></x></a>
