A wide variety of visiting international jazz musicians share their art of making jazz music with us in the DJAZZ series 'Belgium Sessions'. In these sessions, some of Europe's finest musicians perform their own, original music. This MotorMusic Jazz Sessions episode features Belgian musicians from jazz duo SCHNTZL: Hendrik Lasure (piano) and Casper Van De Velde (drums). The pair first met respectively, at ages of 12 and 14 and have been playing together since. SCHNTZL questions the limits of musical vulnerability. How can strict composition and free improvisation be combined? How do acoustic and electronic elements fit together? The minimalist way in which they answer these questions leaves enough space for silence and plunges you into the essence of music.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200606/1410026401-The-motormusic-jazz-sessions-schntzl</w></i><x></x></a>
