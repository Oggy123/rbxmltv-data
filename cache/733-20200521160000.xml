Young Taiwanese, born in the 1980's who grew up as spoilt brats, raised by parents who made their fortunes thrived during Taiwan's economic miracle years. The straberries are much unlike their parents, who hard work and commitment helped grow Taiwan from one of the poorest countries in Asia to one of the wealthiest.
