Her spiritual music expresses the horrific impact of slavery on millions of African people stolen from their homeland. For Odetta, folk music—be it spirituals, blues or field songs—was a vehicle for expressing the racism and injustice experienced by black people dating back to the days of slavery. This 1964 episode of Face au Public shows the melancholy of the era.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200418/1390175393-Face-au-public-odetta</w></i><x></x></a>
