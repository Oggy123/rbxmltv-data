The band is in top form and the show both looks and sounds spectacular. The concert was held shortly before the release of their &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot; album and the track listing combines new songs interspersed with their classic hits. This is a great live concert by one of the most successful rock acts of the last twenty years.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20190817/1310109119-Stone-temple-pilots-alive-in-the-windy-city</w></i><x></x></a>
