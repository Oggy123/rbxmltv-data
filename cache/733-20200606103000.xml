Then we take a panoramic cable car in order to reach one of the highest peaks on the island: Pico de Areeiro. Nature here is the uncontested queen, and it expresses itself with richness and fantasy, which we see in the many botanical gardens of the island, that have many different and rare species of plants from all over the world. This powerful nature flourishes at its best even at sea, where we sail out, in order to observe amazing dolphins and whales.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200606/1410106633-Around-the-world-in-80-islands-the-garden-of-the-atlantic-ocean-madeira</w></i><x></x></a>
