The current chief of the Veddha is Vanniyala Ehto. He cares for the health and well being of his people using a tradition taught to him by his father. In turn, he is passing on these sacred traditions on to his son who is just gaining in confidence with learning these ways. Come with us as we walk through the jungles and see examples of healing plants and demonstrations of how they are used for specific types of healing.</k></p><i><t>Dokument</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200418/1390342068-Guides-gurus-sri-lanka</w></i><x></x></a>
