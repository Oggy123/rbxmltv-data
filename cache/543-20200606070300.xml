In the UK it charted at No.16 and has sold over 400,000 copies. On September 18, 2007, the band performed the complete album live for the first time at Town Hall in New York City. The band has maintained a hugely successful career with global album sales now in excess of 20 million but they have always saved their finest moments for the live arena. Now for the first time a Counting Crows live concert film is available.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/iconcerts/20200606/1410067914-August-and-everything-after</w></i><x></x></a>
