Rameau Sr. was also a musician, but he had destined his son for a career in law. Music seems to have been in his blood, though, and after having taught himself to play various instruments as well as basic music theory, he was allowed to start a career in music - at long last - at age 18. Music took him all over Europe and eventually brought him to the French court. This broadcast shows a performance by Roland Pöntinen of his 'Gavotte et doubles'.</d></p><i><t>Zábava</t><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200420/1390227947-Rameau-gavotte-et-doubles</w></i><x></x></a>
