2018. Sara Lucas, Daniela Serna, Maria Fernanda Gonzalez &amp; Lara Klaus. WOMEX, Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain</k><d>Since 1994, World Music Expo (WOMEX) has been attracting musicians, agents, a great number of press agencies, as well as media companies from all over the world. Its main exposition event has been held in various locations throughout Europe, including Berlin, Brussels, Marseille, Stockholm, Seville, Cardiff, and Budapest. In 2018, WOMEX was held in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria. One of its showcase participants, Ladama, is a quintet of women multi-instrumentalists from Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia and the United States who not only perform as a touring band, but also strive to engage youth in their respective communities in the process of musicmaking, composition and audio production through collaboration and performance workshops. Ladama is a positive force in times urgently in need of tolerance and communication.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20190717/1300253336-Ladama-womex-2018</w></i><x></x></a>
