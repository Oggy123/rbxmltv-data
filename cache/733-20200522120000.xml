It includes contributions by many of those who knew Nureyev during this period - principally his long-time friend Yasemin Pirinccioglu, who worked with him to stage &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; in Istanbul, and is the keeper of his Turkish archive. It combines these with hitherto unseen footage from private films made at the time.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20200522/1400313820-Rudolf-nureyev</w></i><x></x></a>
