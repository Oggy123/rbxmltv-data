A wide variety of international jazz musicians give a creative, up-close and inside insight into their art of playing jazz music. Young talent and established jazz musicians play to their heart's content: take for instance this unusual performance by the multi-ethnic ensemble Hijaz. This band explores the dialogue between piano and the oud, a pear-shaped stringed instrument from the East. Hijaz is a close-knit quartet that explores the differences and similarities between Mediterranean cultures in order to create moments of harmony, warmth, and great musical beauty.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200416/1390152169-Belgium-sessions-hijaz</w></i><x></x></a>
