Its name 'BIRD' refers to the nickname of the legendary New York jazz saxophonist, bebop co-founder Charlie Parker (1920-1955). BIRD serves Neapolitan pizzas, good wines, no-nonsense beers and an all-round metropolitan rawness. Since 2014, this urban jazz club and DJAZZ.tv have been collaborating for a series of music programmes: 'BIRD.tv', allowing you to experience the best BIRD concerts and interviews as from the first row! This episode is a fantastic registration of the after party of the North Sea Jazz Festival: Boogieball. This mega jam session is a great coming together of, amongst others, Anthony Hamilton, Anderson Paak, Christian Scott, Cory Henry and Kneebody!</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200418/1390175388-Birdtv-boogieball-with-the-npg-and-questlove</w></i><x></x></a>
