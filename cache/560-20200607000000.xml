The opera, based on a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte, is a romantic comedy about the complexity of relationships between men and women. With his sensual, spirited and passionate music, Mozart poses fundamental questions about love and brings to the libretto surprising psychological depth and an underlying seriousness not present in the original farce. The major roles are played by Lionel Lhote, Daniel Behle, Vito Priante, Maria Bengtsson, Tove Dahlberg and Elena Galitskava in this 2011 performance from the Opera de Lyon in France.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200607/1410027870-Mozart-cosi-fan-tutte</w></i><x></x></a>
