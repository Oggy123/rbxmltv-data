Although this was their inaugural collaboration, the two young artists found a perfect understanding around this romantic programme. The two featured works were written very few years apart from one another (Brahms' first sonata for violin and piano in 1879 and Franck's sonata in A in 1886). The Brahms sonata was recorded by Kristof Barati a few years ago, while Franck's is known to be a favourite of Lucas Debargue. The virtuoso piano part suits his gigantic hands and the fantasy of the third movement his love for improvisation. The cyclic form and the many echoes between the piano and violin parts unite the two artists, like accomplices in possession of the best assets to bring in all the emotion these romantic works have to offer. The listener is suddenly in a position to re-discover the scores and cannot but join the admiration marks that escape from the audience in between the movements. A very moving performance which deserves its benchmark status.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/brava-hdtv/20200520/1400191405-Barati-debargue-perform-debussy-brahms-franck</w></i><x></x></a>
