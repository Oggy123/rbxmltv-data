The group offers its own musical arrangements of Eastern Europe traditional and composed pieces; they incorporate and mix the rhythms, instruments and typical harmonies from Latin, Caribbean, Jazz and Oriental styles. Each piece played by the ensemble gives place to improvisation, especially for Sergiu Popa, a virtuoso whose brilliant works are often spontaneous. The Ensemble also presents a more semi-classical repertoire, including arranged folk songs from Russia and Moldova in collaboration with Moldavian vocalist Marina Negruta.</k></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/docubox-hd/20190817/1310163604-In-concert-sergiu-popa-ensemble</w></i><x></x></a>
