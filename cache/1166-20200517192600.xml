As a team of individualists, they mix contemporary and traditional jazz in a whole new way, playing well-known standards as well as their own compositions. With Tim Hagans on trumpet, Greg Osby on alto sax, Javon Jackson on tenor sax, Kevin Hays on piano, Esslet Esslet on double bass, and Bill Stewart on drums, this is an amazing line up. Over the years, they have each established themselves as forward-thinking and inventive band leaders, composers, and studio musicians, astonishing audiences around the world with their creativity and technical versatility.</d></p><i><w>http://tv.sms.cz/televize/djazz/20200517/1400158541-Jazz-open-stuttgart-blue-note-all-stars</w></i><x></x></a>
